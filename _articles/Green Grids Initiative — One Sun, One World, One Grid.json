    "content": "Green Grids Initiative — One Sun, One World, One Grid  (GGI — OSOWOG) is an initiative by International Solar Alliance (ISA), India and United Kingdom to build a global green energy grid, primarily focusing on solar and wind energy.\n\n\n== History ==\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed the One Sun, One World, One Grid (OSOWOG) initiative in the first assembly of ISA in October 2018. United Kingdom and India agreed to merge their Green Grids Initiative (GGI) and OSOWOG initiatives respectively, during the UK—India Virtual Summit in May 2021. On the sidelines of COP26 in November 2021, the merged initiative was launched. About 83 ISA member nations have endorsed the initiative. The ISA and the World Bank are instrumental in the implementation of initiative.\n\n\n== Initiative ==\nThe project has proposed three phases. In the first phase, the grids of Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia would be integrated. In second phase, the Asian grid will be connected with African grid. In last phase, the grid will be the global grid. The feasibility study has been commissioned by ISA.India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar have cross-border transmission infrastructure which could be upgraded for the initiative.ISA director general Ajay Mathur said that the proposed grid could have interconnection capacity of 2600 gigawatt by 2050.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGlobal Energy Interconnection\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUK COP26 websiteISA website",
