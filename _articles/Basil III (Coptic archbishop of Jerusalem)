During his reign, the Archdiocese of Jerusalem also possessed jurisdiction over the easternmost provinces of Egypt in Al-Sharqyia, Port Said, Ismailia, and Suez. \n\n\n== Early life and monasticism ==\nHe was born in Akhmim, Sohag Governorate, Egypt. He joined the Monastery of Saint Anthony the Great in the Eastern Desert, and was tonsured a monk with the name, Monk James Saint Anthony (Arabic: أبونا الراهب يعقوب الأنطونى‎). Later he was ordained a priest, and then elevated to the rank of Hegumen, and sent to assist in the service of the See of Jerusalem.\n\n\n== Episcopate ==\n\n\n=== Consecration ===\nFollowing the death of Metropolitan Timothy of Jerusalem, in 1925, Hegumen James Saint Anthony was nominated for the See. He was consecrated as Basil III, Metropolitan of Jerusalem and Archbishop of all Palestine, Philadelphia of Jordan, and all the Near East, by the hands of Pope Cyril V of Alexandria and the Bishops and Metropolitans of the Holy Synod, on December 27, 1925.Although the Archdiocese of Jerusalem had traditionally incorporated the eastern delta, Al-Daqahlia, Al-Gharbiya, and Damietta, these provinces were cleaved off and joined into the new Diocese of Al-Mansoura, following the death of Metropolitan Timothy of Jerusalem. Thus, they were not included in Metropolitan Basil III's jurisdiction.\n\n\n== Death ==\nHe died on May 9, 1935, after sitting on the See for 10 years. He was buried in the tomb of Metropolitan Basil II of Jerusalem, in the Monastery of Saint Anthony in Joppa.\n\n\n== References ==",
