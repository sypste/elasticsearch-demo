The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.\n\n\n== Description and history ==\nThe Chase House is set at the southwest corner of US 202 and Kanokolus Road in the center of Unity.  Set back from the main road, it is a 2+1⁄2-story brick structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, end chimneys, and a stone foundation.  The main facade is symmetrically arranged, with a center entrance flanked by sidelight windows and topped by a fanlight window.  A 1+1⁄2-story wood-frame ell extends to the rear, and there is a barn near the rear of the property that was once connected to the house via a shed.The property on which the house stands was settled by Stephen Chase in 1782.  He built a Cape style house about 1810 which forms the ell of the present house, which was built by his son Hezekiah in 1826.  Hezekiah's son George (1844-1919) was born and raised here.  He attended Bates College in its second class, and eventually became a professor of English there.  In 1894 he became the second president of Bates, succeeding Oren Cheney and overseeing a major period of its growth.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Waldo County, Maine\n\n\n== References ==",
