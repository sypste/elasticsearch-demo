After the war, they were always among the top teams in Greece. The first National Championship was played in 1968 and Iraklis was also able to contribute to the National Teams with plenty of players. During the 70's, Iraklis participated twice in the championship finals, thanks to the contribution of Nikos Antoniadis, the greatest athlete in the history of volleyball in Greece. In 1987, 1989 and 1992 Iraklis made it to the European Cup and in 1997 came the outburst of the team.\nThanks to an organized effort, Iraklis played three consecutive Championship finals and finally won its first title -the Greek Cup- in 2000. Two years later, the team won both the Championship and the Cup titles, while finishing third in the CEV Champions League final-four held in Opole, Poland.\nThe next four years Iraklis dominated in Greece, confirming his superiority by winning one Championship (2005), three Greek Cups (2004, 2005, 2006) and two Greek Super Cups (2004, 2005), but mostly by participating in three more CEV Champions League final-fours. In 2004 in Belgorod, Russia, the team finished in the fourth place. Next year, the presence of world-class players such as Lloy Ball, Thomas Hoff and Clayton Stanley helped the team to reach the final-four which took place in Thessaloniki, Greece. Iraklis beat Lokomotiv Belgorod in the semi-final, but lost 1-3 to Tours VB in the final, despite the outstanding support by the fans. In 2006, Iraklis made it again to the final in Rome, Italy, to be beaten by Sisley Treviso 3-1. About 4,000 Iraklis fans traveled to Rome to support the team, creating fantastic atmosphere and setting a record for an away crowd in a volleyball game.\nThe following season marked the beginning of a transitional period. Many of the top players were released from the team, while the budget was cut in half. Even so, the team's dominance in Greece continued. In 2007, Iraklis finished third in regular season, but managed to win the Championship beating Olympiacos S.C. in the semi-finals and Panathinaikos VC in the finals, having both times a disadvantage. The next Championship (2007–08) had the same conclusion. Iraklis defeated Panathinaikos VC in the finals (without losing a single game) and were crowned Champions for the fourth time in their history.\n\n\n== Current squad ==\nSeason 2016–2017\n\n\n=== Technical and managerial staff ===\n\n\n== Notable former players ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Notable coaches ===\n\n Alekos Leonis\n Flavio Gulinelli\n Anders Kristiansson (FIVB Hall of Fame)\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n\n=== Domestic ===\nGreek League\n\nWinners (5): 2001–02, 2004–05, 2006–07, 2007–08, 2011–12\nRunners-up (8): 1970–71, 1974–75, 1998–99, 1999-00, 2000–01, 2002–03, 2005–06, 2010-11Greek Cup\n\nWinners (6): 1999–00, 2001–02, 2004–05, 2004–05, 2005–06, 2011–12\nRunners-up (4): 2000–01, 2010–11, 2017–18, 2018–19Greek Super Cup\n\nWinners (4) (record): 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008\nRunners-up (2): 2000, 2006Greek A2 League\n\nWinners (1): 2018-19\n\n\n=== European ===\nCEV Champions League\n\nRunners-up (3): 2004-05, 2005-06, 2008-09\nThird place (1): 2001-02\nFourth place (1): 2003-04\n\n\n== Sponsorships ==\nGreat Sponsor: Pame Stoixima\nOfficial Sport Clothing Manufacturer: Patrick (sportswear company)\nOfficial Broadcaster: Nova Sports\n\n\n== Women ==\n\n\n=== Current Squad 2012/2013 ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial SitesIraklis VC - Official Site (in Greek and English)PressBlue Arena (in Greek)", "links": ["2008–09 CEV Champions League", "2010–11 Volleyleague (Greece)", "2011–12 Volleyleague (Greece)", "2012–13 Volleyleague (Greece)", "2013–14 Volleyleague (Greece)", "2014–15 Volleyleague (Greece)", "2015–16 Volleyleague (Greece)", "2016–17 Volleyleague (Greece)", "2017–18 Volleyleague (Greece)", "2018–19 Volleyleague (Greece)", "2019–20 Volleyleague (Greece)", "2020–21 Volleyleague (Greece)", "2021–22 Volleyleague (Greece)", "A1 (Greek volleyball league)", "A1 Ethniki Volleyball", "A2 Ethniki Volleyball", "ACH Volley Bled", "AONS Milon", "AZS Częstochowa", "Alekos Leonis", "Anders Kristiansson", "Andreas Andreadis", "Andrej Kravárik", "Aon hotVolleys Vienna", "Apostolos Armenakis", "Argentina", "Austria", "Beauvais Oise", "Belarus", "Belgium", "Belgorod", "Brook Billings", "Bulgaria", "CEV Champions League", "CV Pòrtol", "Christos Dimitrakopoulos", "Chrysanthos Kyriazis", "Clayton Stanley", "Copra Nord Meccanica Piacenza", "Cuba", "Cyprus", "Czech Republic", "Daniel Vargas (volleyball)", "Dimitris Rizopoulos", "Europe", "Farnese Hercules", "Fenerbahçe Men's Volleyball", "Filippos Veria", "Flavio Gulinelli", "Foinikas Syros V.C.", "France", "Frank Depestele", "Frantz Granvorka", "Freddy Brooks", "Fédération Internationale de Volleyball", "G.S.
