An earlier name for the area was Fishers Grant after a grant of land made to John Fisher in 1765. The only populated reserve of the Pictou Landing First Nation is named Fisher's Grant 24 and is located 3km north-east of Pictou Landing.\nThe Nova Scotia Railway reached here in 1867. It was the main route for travelers to Upper Canada in the ice-free months until the opening of the Intercolonial Railway in 1876. The steamship Mayflower carried passengers and freight across the harbour.  A map published in 1879 shows four piers at Pictou Landing, three of them carrying track of the Intercolonial rail road and two of these piers belonging to coal companies.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nCameron, James M.
