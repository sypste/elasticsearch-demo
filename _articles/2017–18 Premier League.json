Any player whom the three-man panel unanimously decided had caused an opponent to be sent off or had won a penalty as a result of deceiving the referee by simulation would be charged by the Football Association with \"Successful Deception of a Match Official\" which carried a penalty of suspension for two matches. Everton striker Oumar Niasse became the first Premier League player to be punished under the new rule.\n\n\n=== Summary ===\nManchester City were confirmed as Premier League champions following Manchester United's 0–1 defeat at home to West Bromwich Albion in the 33rd round. Manchester City had started the Premier League season with an away win over Brighton & Hove Albion in August. After a draw against Everton, Manchester City won eighteen games in a row. During this time they secured first position and held it for the remainder of the season. On 7 April, Manchester City hosted Manchester United in the local derby, in which a win would have secured their position as champions. United came back from 2-0 down at half-time to win 3-2 and deny their rivals the title; however, the following week they lost to bottom club West Bromwich Albion, a result which, coupled with Manchester City's victory over Tottenham Hotspur, ensured an unassailable lead with five games left.During the campaign Manchester City broke and set several new club and English football records. They established national records in consecutive away (11) and overall (20) victories in all competitions; set a new English record for consecutive league wins (18); equalled the Premier League record for consecutive away league wins (11) and set club records by achieving 28 consecutive games unbeaten in all competitions; 30 consecutive games unbeaten in the league; 20 consecutive home wins in all competitions; and winning 14 away games in a season. They won their fifth English league title, and completed their second league and League Cup double in four years.\nDefending champions Chelsea started the season badly, losing their opening game to Burnley 2–3; the first time the holders were defeated at home in their first match. A win at one of the title favourites, Tottenham, in their second game seemed to get their defence back on track, but results in September, including losing 0–1 to Manchester City, left them six points behind the leaders in fourth place. They failed to show the consistency of the previous season, and finished in fifth place, leading to Antonio Conte's dismissal as manager a year after leading them to the title. \nManchester United started the season strongly winning their first three games without conceding a goal and led the table until mid-September. They finished in 2nd, their highest finish and points total (81) since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson. \nLiverpool finished fourth for a second consecutive season, buoyed by the signing of Mohamed Salah; his 32 goals broke a Premier League record for most goals scored in a 38-game season, beating the 31 achieved by Cristiano Ronaldo, Alan Shearer and Luis Suarez. \nArsenal had a poor season, finishing sixth overall. Long-serving manager Arsène Wenger announced his departure from the club on 20 April 2018. Their final home game was an emphatic 5–0 defeat of Burnley which guaranteed qualification to the group stage of the Europa League.Despite the defeat, Burnley finished in seventh place, their best finish in English football since 1973–74. This meant they would be entered into the second qualifying round of the Europa League, their first competitive European football campaign in 50 years. Their strong finish led to manager Sean Dyche and defender James Tarkowski being nominated for the Premier League Manager of the Season and Premier League Player of the Season awards respectively.Stoke City were the first team to be relegated to the EFL Championship when they lost 1–2 to Crystal Palace in their penultimate game. Although Stoke were only three points from safety with one game remaining, fellow strugglers Swansea and Southampton still had to play each other, meaning that Stoke would be unable to catch both of those teams and finish fourth from bottom. The game between Swansea and Southampton ended in a 1–0 away win for Southampton, which also meant that despite a five-game unbeaten run, West Bromwich Albion became the second team to be relegated to the Championship on 8 May 2018. Following their 1–2 defeat at the hands of Stoke on the final matchday, Swansea City were also relegated. This meant that all three promoted teams, Newcastle United, Brighton & Hove Albion and Huddersfield Town, survived relegation for the first time since the 2011-12 campaign. \n\n\n== Teams ==\nTwenty teams competed in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the Championship. The promoted teams were Newcastle United, Brighton & Hove Albion and Huddersfield Town, returning to the top flight after an absence of one, thirty-four and forty-five years respectively. This was also both Brighton & Hove Albion and Huddersfield Town's first season in the Premier League. They replaced Hull City, Middlesbrough (both teams relegated after a season's presence) and Sunderland (relegated after ten years in the top flight).\n\n\n=== Stadiums and locations ===\n\nNote: Table lists in alphabetical order.\n\n\n=== Personnel and kits ===\nAdditionally, referee kits were made by Nike, sponsored by EA Sports, and Nike had a new match ball, the Ordem V Premier League.\n\n\n=== Managerial changes ===\n\n\n== League table ==\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== Season statistics ==\n\n\n=== Scoring ===\n\n\n==== Top scorers ====\n\n\n==== Hat-tricks ====\n\nNotes4 Player scored 4 goals(H) – Home team(A) – Away team\n\n\n==== Most assists ====\n\n\n=== Clean sheets ===\n\n\n=== Discipline ===\n\n\n==== Player ====\nMost yellow cards: 11 Oriol Romeu (Southampton)\nMost red cards: 2 Wilfred Ndidi (Leicester City)\n Jonjo Shelvey (Newcastle United)\n\n\n==== Club ====\nMost yellow cards: 73West Bromwich Albion\nWest Ham UnitedMost red cards: 5Leicester City\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n=== Monthly awards ===\n\n\n=== Annual awards ===\n\n\n== Attendances ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website", "links": ["12BET", "1973–74 Football League First Division", "1992–93 FA Premier League", "1993–94 FA Premier League", "1994–95 FA Premier League", "1995–96 FA Premier League", "1996–97 FA Premier League", "1997–98 FA Premier League", "1998–99 FA Premier League", "1999–2000 FA Premier League", "2000–01 FA Premier League", "2001–02 FA Premier League", "2002–03 FA Premier League", "2003–04 FA Premier League", "2004–05 FA Premier League", "2005–06 FA Premier League", "2006–07 FA Premier League", "2007–08 Premier League", "2008–09 Premier League", "2009–10 Premier League", "2010–11 Premier League", "2011–12 FA Premier League", "2011–12 Premier League", "2012–13 Premier League", "2013–14 Premier League", "2014–15 Premier League", "2015–16 Premier League", "2016–17 EFL Championship", "2016–17 Premier League", "2016–17 in English football", "2017 A Lyga", "2017 Albanian Supercup", "2017 Allsvenskan", "2017 Andorran Supercup", "2017 Armenian Supercup", "2017 Azerbaijan Supercup", "2017 Belarusian Premier League", "2017 Belarusian Super Cup", "2017 Belgian Super Cup", "2017 Bulgarian Supercup", "2017 Czechoslovak Supercup", "2017 DFL-Supercup", "2017 Deildabikar", "2017 Eliteserien", "2017 Erovnuli Liga", "2017 Estonian Supercup", "2017 FAI Cup", "2017 FA Community Shield", "2017 FIFA Confederations Cup", "2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup", "2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup", "2017 Faroe Islands Cup", "2017 Faroe Islands Premier League", "2017 Faroe Islands Super Cup", "2017 Georgian Cup", "2017 Georgian Super Cup", "2017 Icelandic Cup", "2017 Icelandic Super Cup", "2017 Israel Super Cup", "2017 Johan Cruyff Shield", "2017 Kazakhstan Cup", "2017 Kazakhstan Premier League", "2017 Kazakhstan Super Cup", "2017 LTV Super Cup", "2017 Latvian Football Cup", "2017 Latvian Higher League", "2017 League of Ireland Cup", "2017 League of Ireland Premier Division", "2017 Lithuanian Football Cup", "2017 Lithuanian Supercup", "2017 Maltese Super Cup", "2017 Meistriliiga", "2017 Mesterfinalen", "2017 Moldovan National Division", "2017 Moldovan Super Cup", "2017 Northern Ireland Super Cup", "2017 Norwegian Football Cup", "2017 Pepe Reyes Cup", "2017 Polish SuperCup", "2017 President of Ireland's Cup", "2017 Russian Super Cup", "2017 Super Coppa Sammarinese", "2017 Supercopa de España", "2017 Supercoppa Italiana", "2017 Supercupa României", "2017 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira", "2017 Szuperkupa", "2017 Trophée des Champions", "2017 Turkish Super Cup", "2017 UEFA Super Cup", "2017 Ukrainian Super Cup", "2017 Veikkausliiga", "2017 in association football", "2017 Úrvalsdeild", "2017–18 A.F.C.
