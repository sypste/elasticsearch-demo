{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper%27d_Up", "title": "Paper'd Up", "summary": "\"Paper'd Up\" is a song by American West Coast hip hop recording artist Snoop Dogg, taken from his six studio album, Paid tha Cost to Be da Bo$$ (2002). It was produced by Fredwreck and features guest appearances by Kokane and Traci Nelson. The beat, drum breaks and harmonies are heavily sampled from Dennis Edward's 1984 Disco Classic 'Don't Look Any Further' featuring Siedah Garrett. The oriental vocal sample is from Ofra Haza's song Im Nin'alu. This combination of sample material was already employed by Erik B. & Rakim in 1987 for their dancefloor classic Paid In Full, which was made famous by Coldcut 's Seven Minutes of Madness Remix.", "content": "\"Paper'd Up\" is a song by American West Coast hip hop recording artist Snoop Dogg, taken from his six studio album, Paid tha Cost to Be da Bo$$ (2002).
