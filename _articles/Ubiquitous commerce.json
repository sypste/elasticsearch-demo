Ubiquitous commerce or uCommerce should not be confused with U.Commerce, which is a set of products and services offered by TouchNet Information Systems, Inc. and is a registered U.S. trademark (Reg. 4,069,063).\n\n\n== Core Concepts ==\nAccording to Richard T. Watson the next generation of commerce referred to as Ubiquitous Commerce (or U-Commerce) includes four major features:\n\nUbiquitous = represents the ability to be connect at any time and in any place as well as the integration of human-computer interaction into most devices and processes, e.g. household objects.\nUniqueness = stands for the unique identification of each customer or user regarding his identity, current context, needs and location resulting in an individual service.\nUniversal = is related to everyone’s devices which can be used multifunctional and as well as universal –you will always be connected no matter of your place.\nUnison = constitutes the data integration across applications and devices to provide users consistent and fully access to required information independent of device and location. The term unison also relates to fully synchronised devices at any time.\n\n\n== Areas ==\nU-Commerce is described as the evolution of E-Commerce and M-Commerce also combining the areas of V-commerce, Television-Commerce (T-commerce) as well as Silent-Commerce (S-Commerce).\n\n\n== Technologies ==\nThe origin and development of Ubiquitous Commerce is based on various information and communication technologies. These technologies were driving forces for the evolution to business transactions at any time and in any place and so they will be in the future.\nAmong them are the following examples:\n\nInternet as the fundamental technology and sourcemobile data services regarding M-Commerce which are especially Wireless LAN, UMTS, HSDPA and in the future 4G / WiMAXTV technologies/add-ons like Teletext and increasingly IPTVtechnologies enhancing the communication of devices (EDI, XML, Web service)In addition, there are also technologies regarding the concept of Ubiquitous Computing which are and will be the main driving forces for the Ubiquitous Commerce. These are mainly the following:\n\ntechnologies of M2M communication, which include some of the technologies mentioned abovemethods for the automatic identification and data capture (Auto-ID) e.g. GPS und RFIDin the future also smart and self-organizing devices/systems and the related technologies like sensors, AI\n\n\n== Opportunities and threats ==\nIn conjunction of the evolution of ubiquitous commerce in daily life and the approaching pervasiveness, a few opportunities as well as threats can be identified.Opportunities:\n\nindividual advertising and also information supply e.g. based on location, time or mood of the customer\nhigh availability of services\nnew potential revenue for supplier and accordingly new business models\nadvanced analysis alternatives for suppliers and customers (location, time, habit)\nincreasing mobility of customers and suppliersThreats:\n\ninformation privacy and threatening of mass surveillance\nincreasing requirements due to more diversity and quantity of devices and also energy consumption\nInformation overload and likely complexity - also Big Data\nhigher vulnerability to spoofing and security holes; e.g. as a result of more targets\nrising exclusion of the elderly based on requirements of higher technical skills\n\"desocialization\" of customer and supplier\n\n\n== See also ==\nUbiquitous computing\nElectronic Business\nElectronic Commerce\nMobile commerce\nV-commerce\nSilent commerce\nMachine-to-Machine\n\n\n== References ==", "links": ["4G", "Application software", "Artificial intelligence", "Automatic identification and data capture", "Big Data", "Business model", "Communication", "Customer", "Electronic Business", "Electronic Commerce", "Electronic commerce", "Electronic data interchange", "GPS", "HSDPA", "IPTV", "ISBN (identifier)", "Information and communications technology", "Information overload", "Internet", "Machine-to-Machine", "Mass surveillance", "Mobile commerce", "RFID", "Sensor", "Silent commerce", "System", "T-commerce", "Teletext", "UMTS", "Ubiquitous Computing", "Ubiquitous computing", "V-commerce", "Web service", "WiMAX", "Wireless LAN", "XML"]}
