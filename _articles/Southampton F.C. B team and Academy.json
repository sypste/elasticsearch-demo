Academy appeared as second-half substitutes: Luke Shaw (making his debut), Adam Lallana and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n\n\n== Present structure ==\nMatt Hale is the current Academy Director, stepping up from his role as Academy Manager in July 2019. He was replaced as academy manager by his assistant Edd Vahid at the same time. Robin Nicholls is the current assistant Academy Manager. The current academy set up has teams at all age groups from Under 8s all the way through to the professional B team, employing large number of coaches and educational staff. Iain Brunnschweiler is the current Coach Development Manager for the academy. Academy players from the age of 16 up until the age of 18 are often looked after by Host Families within the local area. These families are organised and monitored by Family Liaison Officer Ian Herding.\nHead Scout Martyn Glover oversees academy recruitment alongside Director of Football operations Matt Crocker, who was previously Academy Manager, while Rod Ruddick, Jim Flood, Wayne Stephens and Vince Bartram are all involved in youth recruitment for the academy along with the club scouting team.\nThe aim of the Southampton academy is to \"...produce Premiership class players...\"Currently, Southampton's academy set-up is one of the best in the country and they have regularly reached the latter stages of the FA Youth Cup, as well as being successful in the FA Premier Academy League championship. In the 2010–2011 season the U18s were only just \"...Pipped to the Title...\" by one point on the last day of the season of the Group A league. Southampton had to win and Fulham had to draw or lose for Southampton to come top. After winning 1–3 away to Coventry City the U18s were dismayed to discover Fulham had come back from being 0–3 down versus Leicester City to win 5–3.\nThe academy has joined up with local college Sparsholt College to try to give those footballers who have missed out on a scholarship the opportunity to remain in the game and train and play matches with the Southampton Academy.In May 2013, Andre Villas-Boas, manager of Tottenham Hotspur praised the Southampton Academy for its ability to produce star players, describing it as \"a great school of development\" and comparing it to Sporting Lisbon.In April 2015, a Southampton U21 side won the U21 Premier League Cup, defeating a Blackburn Rovers U21 side in the two-legged final at St Mary's Stadium in front of more than 12,000 fans. Goals from Ryan Seager and Sam Gallagher cancelled out a Matt Targett own goal to give Southampton a 2–1 victory after extra time to win the second edition of the cup.In September 2020, Southampton revamped their Under-23s programme to 'enhance the pathway into the first team for its younger players.' A 'structure and philosophical overhaul' saw the Under-23s side become a B team. The new B team will mirror the training programmes, coaching and style of play of the first team. Training and fixtures, where possible, will also be organised so it does not clash with the first team so the first team manager and coaches can watch the side train or play and also take part in coaching sessions. The side will still continue to participate in the same competitions as before the revamp.Under new club Director of Football Matt Crocker, individual player coaches have been brought into to try and improve players coming through the academy. Lee Skyrme was appointed B team individual player coach in 2021, while Mikey Harris was appointed in the same role for the U18s in the same year.\n\n\n== B team squad ==\nPlayers (excluding scholars) who will qualify as B team players in season 2022–23 (i.e. born on or after 1 January 2001) and who are outside the first team squad.\n\nAs of 10 June 2022Squad numbers represent numbers given to players for first team and EFL Trophy matches only.\n± Denotes a player on an 'extended scholarship'.\n* Denotes a player who is overage (born before 1 January 2001) and outside of the first team squad.Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.
