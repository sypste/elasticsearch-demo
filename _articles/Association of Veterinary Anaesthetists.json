It has its administrative base on Hawkshead Lane in North Mymms, Hertfordshire, at the (main) Hawkshead Campus of the Royal Veterinary College. On April 26, 1993, the European College of Veterinary Anaesthesia and Analgesia (ECVAA) was formed to regulate qualifications in veterinary anaesthesia in Europe and is a member of the European Board of Veterinary Specialisation.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe AVA gives out scholarships and also provides training and education in the area of Veterinary Anaesthetists. A trust fund was established in the early 1970s and each year they give out grants to trainees studying for both RCVS and ECVAA Certificates and Diplomas in veterinary anaesthesia.\n\n\n=== Publications ===\nThe AVA publishes the journal Veterinary Anaesthesia and Analgesia six times a year, which is also the official journal of the European College of Veterinary Anaesthesia and Analgesia and the American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAnesthesiology\nList of veterinary associations\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAssociation of Veterinary Anaesthetists", "links": ["ACE mixture", "ASA physical status classification system", "Airway management", "Allergic reactions to anaesthesia", "American Association of Nurse Anesthetists", "American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia", "American Society of Anesthesia Technologists & Technicians", "American Society of Anesthesiologists", "Anaesthesia", "Anaesthesia Trauma and Critical Care", "Anaesthetic machine", "Anaesthetic technician", "Anesthesia", "Anesthesia awareness", "Anesthesia cart", "Anesthesia provision in the United States", "Anesthesiologist", "Anesthesiologist assistant", "Anesthesiology", "Anesthetic vaporizer", "Arterial catheter", "Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland", "Australian Society of Anaesthetists", "Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists", "Baricity", "Bispectral index", "Bloodâ€“gas partition coefficient", "Boyle's machine", "Bronchoscopy", "Capnography", "Cardiothoracic anesthesiology", "Certified Anesthesia Technician", "Certified Anesthesia Technologist", "Concentration effect", "Critical emergency medicine", "Dental anesthesia", "Dogliotti's principle", "Double-lumen endotracheal tube", "Drug-induced amnesia", "Effects of early-life exposures to anesthesia on the brain", "Emergence delirium", "Endobronchial blocker", "Entropy monitoring", "Epidural", "European College of Veterinary Anaesthesia and Analgesia", "Fick principle", "Fink effect", "Gas cylinder", "General anaesthesia", "Geriatric anesthesia", "Goldman index", "Guedel's classification", "Helsinki Declaration for Patient Safety in Anaesthesiology", "Hertfordshire", "History of general anesthesia", "History of neuraxial anesthesia", "History of tracheal intubation", "ISBN (identifier)", "ISNI (identifier)", "Inferior alveolar nerve anaesthesia", "Instruments used in anesthesiology", "Intensive care medicine", "Intercostal nerve block", "International Anesthesia Research Society", "Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring", "Laryngeal mask airway", "Laryngeal tube", "List of veterinary associations", "Local anesthesia", "Local anesthetic toxicity", "Malignant hyperthermia", "Mallampati score", "Minimum alveolar concentration", "Monitoring (medicine)", "Nerve block", "Neuraxial blockade", "Neuromuscular monitoring", "North Mymms", "Nurse anesthetist", "Obstetric anesthesiology", "Odom's indicator", "Operating department practitioners", "Oral sedation dentistry", "Outline of anesthesia", "Pain medicine", "Penthrox inhaler", "Perioperative mortality", "Physicians' assistant (anaesthesia)", "Postanesthetic shivering", "Postoperative nausea and vomiting", "Postoperative residual curarization", "Relative analgesia machine", "Royal College of Anaesthetists", "Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons", "Royal Veterinary College", "Second gas effect", "Sedation", "Spinal anaesthesia", "Thyromental distance", "Topical anesthetic", "Tracheal intubation", "Twilight anesthesia", "VIAF (identifier)", "Veterinary anesthesia", "Veterinary medicine", "Veterinary specialties"]}
