{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sit_on_My_Face", "title": "Sit on My Face", "summary": "\"Sit on My Face\" is a short song by the members of the comedy troupe Monty Python which originally appeared on the album Monty Python's Contractual Obligation Album and later appeared on the compilation Monty Python Sings. Written by Eric Idle, the song's lyrics are sung to the melody of \"Sing As We Go\" (1934) by Harry Parr-Davies, made popular by Gracie Fields. The opening gives way to the voices of The Fred Tomlinson Singers singing \"Sit on my face and tell me that you love me.\" The remaining lyrics contain numerous references to fellatio and cunnilingus, such as \"when I'm between your thighs you blow me away\" and \"life can be fine if we both 69\".\nThe song opened the 1982 film Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl, where it was lip-synched by Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones dressed as waiters in a performance which, at the suggestion of Python touring member Neil Innes, ended with them revealing their bare backsides. In 2002, a similar rendition was mimed by Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam and Neil Innes at the Concert for George, a memorial concert for George Harrison which took place at the Royal Albert Hall. At the end of this rendition the four men turned their backs to face a portrait of George Harrison, thereby revealing their naked buttocks and effectively mooning the Albert Hall audience. In 2012 it was featured as an animated number in A Liar's Autobiography, performed by the London Gay Men's Chorus, both on the recorded soundtrack and live, as a flash mob, during the screening shown during the London Film Festival. The song also opened the second half of Monty Python's 2014 reunion shows where it accompanied a suggestive dance routine by the 20-strong dance ensemble, with Eric Idle and Michael Palin encouraging an audience singalong.", "content": "\"Sit on My Face\" is a short song by the members of the comedy troupe Monty Python which originally appeared on the album Monty Python's Contractual Obligation Album and later appeared on the compilation Monty Python Sings.

Nonetheless, the Pythons decided to retain the song.\nThe US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has ruled that the song is actionably indecent, concluding that \"despite English accent and 'ambient noise' … the lyrics were sufficiently understandable\". In 1992, it pursued legal action against KGB-FM, a San Diego, California classic rock radio station, for playing the song, eventually forcing the station to pay US$9,200 in fines.\n\n\n== French adaptation ==\nA French language rendition of the song presented in Edinburgh in 2003 translated the title as \"Cum in My Mouth\". According to producer Rémy Renoux, \"Cum in My Mouth is … what Monty Python would have written today.\" Renoux also pointed out that a literal translation into French would not fit the melody of the song, and claimed that the translation met with the approval of the Monty Python team.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCensorship of broadcasting in the United States\nCensorship of music\n\n\n== References ==", "links": ["69 (sex position)", "A Liar's Autobiography: The Untrue Story of Monty Python's Graham Chapman", "A Liar's Autobiography: Volume VI", "A Pocketful of Python", "A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)", "Absolutely Anything", "Actionable indecency", "Albatross (Monty Python sketch)", "All You Need Is Cash", "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life", "An Evening Without Monty Python", "And Now for Something Completely Different", "Anne Elk's Theory on Brontosauruses", "Another Monty Python Record", "Architects Sketch", "Argument Clinic", "At Last the 1948 Show", "Bert Fegg's Nasty Book for Boys and Girls", "Brian Song", "Broaden Your Mind", "Bruces' Philosophers Song", "Bruces sketch", "Buttocks", "California", "Cambridge Footlights Revue", "Carol Cleveland", "Censorship of broadcasting in the United States", "Censorship of music", "Cheese Shop sketch", "Classic rock", "Colin \"Bomber\" Harris vs Colin \"Bomber\" Harris", "Concert for George", "Copyright infringement", "Crunchy Frog", "Cunnilingus", "DOC (computing)", "Dead Parrot sketch", "Decomposing Composers", "Diaries 1969–1979: The Python Years", "Dirty Hungarian Phrasebook", "Do Not Adjust Your Set", "Edinburgh", "Election Night Special", "Eric Idle", "Eric the Half-a-Bee", "Every Sperm Is Sacred", "Fawlty Towers", "Federal Communications Commission", "Fellatio", "Finland (song)", "Fish Licence", "Four Yorkshiremen sketch", "French language", "Galaxy Song", "George Harrison", "Gracie Fields", "Graham Chapman", "Harry Parr-Davies", "Holy Flying Circus", "How Not to Be Seen", "How to Irritate People", "I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again", "I've Got Two Legs", "ISBN (identifier)", "I Bet You They Won't Play This Song on the Radio", "I Like Chinese", "John Cleese", "KGB-FM", "Kilimanjaro Expedition", "Life of Python", "Lifeboat sketch", "List of Monty Python's Flying Circus episodes", "List of Monty Python projects", "List of recurring Monty Python's Flying Circus characters", "Live at Drury Lane", "MBW (identifier)", "Marriage Guidance Counsellor", "Medical Love Song", "Melody", "Michael Palin", "Monty Python", "Monty Python's Big Red Book", "Monty Python's Complete Waste of Time", "Monty Python's Contractual Obligation Album", "Monty Python's Cow Tossing", "Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus", "Monty Python's Flying Circus", "Monty Python's Flying Circus: Just the Words", "Monty Python's Flying Circus: The Computer Game", "Monty Python's Flying Circus (album)", "Monty Python's Life of Brian", "Monty Python's Life of Brian (album)", "Monty Python's Personal Best", "Monty Python's Previous Record", "Monty Python's The Life of Brian / Monty Python Scrapbook", "Monty Python's The Meaning of Life", "Monty Python's The Meaning of Life (album)", "Monty Python's The Meaning of Life (book)", "Monty Python's The Meaning of Life (video game)", "Monty Python's Tiny Black Round Thing", "Monty Python's Total Rubbish", "Monty Python: Almost the Truth (Lawyers Cut)", "Monty Python: And Now for Something Rather Similar", "Monty Python: The Meaning of Live", "Monty Python & the Quest for the Holy Grail", "Monty Python Live", "Monty Python Live!", "Monty Python Live (Mostly)", "Monty Python Live (mostly)", "Monty Python Live at Aspen", "Monty Python Live at City Center", "Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl", "Monty Python Sings", "Monty Python and the Holy Grail", "Monty Python and the Holy Grail (Book)", "Monty Python v.
