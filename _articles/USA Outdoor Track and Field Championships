Since the year 1992, in the years which feature a Summer Olympics, World Athletics Championships or an IAAF Continental Cup, the championships serve as a way of selecting the best athletes for those competitions.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe history of the competition starts in 1876, when the New York Athletic Club (NYAC) decided to organize a national championships. Having previously held the NYAC Spring and Fall Games. The seventh, eight, and ninth edition of the Fall Games became the country's first, second and third national track and field championships. The Amateur Championship of America (prior to N.A.A.A.) 1876 to 1878 were all held in Mott Haven, New York.  April 22, 1879 N.A.A.A. was formed. The National Association of Amateur Athletes of America (N.A.A.A.), began sponsoring the meeting in 1879, and organized the championships up to 1887. Past N.A.A.A. presidents were 1879 George W Carr was elected president,  1880 & 1881 & 1882 A. H. Curtis was elected president, 1883 & 1884 & 1885 Gilbert H Badeu elected president, and 1887 Walter Storm was elected.  At this point, the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), a more powerful athletic organization, began to hold their own version of the national championships. Two national championships were held in 1888, but the NAAA disbanded after this. The NAAA Championships 1879 to 1888 were all held in New York. Sept 19, 1888 the First AAU Outdoor Championship was held in Detroit, MI.  Sept 14, 1889 Second Annual AAU T&F Championship competition was held at Travers Island, NY.  Oct 11, 1890 Third Annual AAU T&F National Championship competition was held at Washington, DC.  The AAU was the sole organizer of the event for the next ninety years. In 1923, the AAU also sponsored the first American Track & Field championships for women.\nAs a result of the Amateur Sports Act of 1978, the AAU had no longer power over Olympic sports in the United States. A spin-off group, The Athletics Congress, held its first national track and field championships in 1980. The Athletics Congress was renamed USA Track & Field in 1993, and they have organized the annual championships ever since.\n\n\n=== 2020 Olympic Trials Held 2021 ===\nUnited States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC), and the TrackTown USA Local Organizing Committee announced the release of the updated competition schedule for the 2020 U.S. Olympic Team Trials – Track and Field, that will take place June 18-27, 2021, at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon. \n\n\n== Events ==\nThe following athletics events are currently featured on the national championships' program:\n\nSprint: 100 m, 200 m, 400 m\nMiddle distance track events: 800 m, 1500 m\nLong distance track events: 5000 m, 10,000 m\nHurdles: 100 m hurdles, 110 m hurdles, 400 m hurdles, 3000 m steeplechase\nJumps: long jump, triple jump, high jump, pole vault\nThrows: shot put, discus, hammer, javelin\nCombined events: heptathlon, decathlon\nWalks: 20 km walk (road) / 20000 m walk (track)In earlier editions before 1974, running distances were often measured in yards.  All races were in yards until 1928.  From then on, races were measured in meters for Olympic years and yards for other years, except 1933 to 1951 inclusive and 1959. In the early years, the 220 yard hurdles were included for many years in lieu of the 440 yard hurdles. The 220 yard hurdles were first included 1887 through 1962.  USATF website lists Past Outdoor Champions (all events) on the statistic section of their website.The cover page of the 1888 Program states \"First Annual Championship Games Amateur Athletic Union of the United States\".\n\n\n== Editions ==\n\n\n== Split gender editions ==\nNote that the track surface changed over these years.
