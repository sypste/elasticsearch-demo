Here, a 17-year-old boy (depicted as \"dating a high school queen\") meets and begins a relationship with a woman who is \"over 30,\" in her second marriage and having a son that was nearly as old as her teenaged partner. The lyrics focused on the intimacy shared between the two, which in the process met her needs and turned him into a man (\"He made her feel needed/And she made him a man\").\n\n\n== Chart performance ==\n\n\n== References ==",
