Prior to it's closure, and since operations ceased the club has maintained Community amateur sports club (CASC) status, a favourable tax status.\n\n\n== Club History ==\n\n\n=== Operational History ===\nWindrushers originally started at operations at Little Rissington before moving to Bicester in 1956, later merging with the Royal Air Force Gliding & Soaring Association. In July 2004  the club was reformed as a separate entity after the RAFGSA moved to RAF Halton      . The following year it hosted the UK Junior National Championship and its own Regional championship. It also later achieved the British Gliding Association's accreditation as a Junior Gliding Centre. During their operation, Windrushers hosted the following competitions;\n\n\n=== Closure ===\nAfter discussions that took place in early 2020, the new owners of Bicester Airfield, Bicester Heritage, sought to change the lease that allowed WGC to operate on the airfield. WGC would have lost privileges they enjoyed over other users of the airfield, which would have resulted in increased cost and reduced independence to run competitions or expand operations. Bicester Heritage also looked to take over WGC property within the airfield, including the recently renovated clubrooms and workshops. In July 2020, the club left the airfield, with members leaving for various different gliding clubs in the local area such as Oxford Gliding Club, Shenington Gliding Club, Banbury Gliding Club and others further afield. The club maintains it's leased was cancelled and it would have been impossible for them to stay at the airfield under the new operational requirements. \n\n\n==== Club Fleet ====\nWhen the club ceased operations, it maintained that it was not being dissolved and was instead entering a state of \"hibernation\", which meant they did not need to follow the CASC guidelines on disposing of assets (such as aircraft) to other eligible CASC organisations in the local area. Controversially, this now means that the majority of their fleet is unavailable for use by either their own members or those in the local area. The club has leased some of the aircraft (noted below) to some clubs however the terms of the leases are not clear as they are not in the public domain. The senior management team of the club maintains that it is searching for a new location in which to restart operations, and until it has exhausted the funds at it's disposal it will not provide free access to it's fleet to the public.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWindrushers Gliding Club website\nCranfield University Gliding Club\nOxford University Gliding Club",
