It will be used to study the territory of Venezuela and help with planning, agriculture and disaster recovery. It was built and launched by the Chinese and has been named after Venezuelan revolutionary Francisco de Miranda.\n\n\n== Satellite ==\n\nThe satellite was built after a contract between Venezuela and China was signed in Caracas on 26 May 2011, and follows from their previous collaboration on VENESAT-1. The contract, worth $144.8 million USD, included $67.8 million for the satellite, $22m for the launch, $16m for the ground station in Venezuela and $22m for software. The main contractor is China Great Wall Industry Corporation and the satellite is based on the CAST 2000 bus developed by the China Academy of Space Technology. One source posits that VRSS-1 is based upon the Chinese Yaogan-2 reconnaissance satellite.The satellite contains two different resolution cameras. The highest resolution ones have a resolution of 2.5 metres in panchromatic mode, and 10 metres in multispectral mode. The lower resolution cameras have a resolution of 16m. It will provide 350 images a day, with the first one on or about 10 October.The satellite will pass over Venezuela three or four times every 24 hours and will cover the same area of Venezuela every 57 days. It is controlled from the Base Aeroespacial Capitán Manuel Ríos in El Sombrero, Guárico and managed by Venezuela's Bolivarian Agency for Space Activities. It has an estimated life of 5 years.\n\n\n== Launch ==\n\nThe satellite was launched on 29 September 2012 at 4:12 UTC from pad 603 at launch complex 43 at Jiuquan Launch Centre in China. It was launched by a Long March 2D rocket which put the satellite into low Earth orbit. It was given the international designator 2012-052A and the United States Space Command assigned it the Satellite Catalog Number 38782.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nVenesat-1\nVRSS-2\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSatélite Miranda (VRSS-1) (in Spanish)", "links": ["2011 in spaceflight", "2012 in spaceflight", "2013 in spaceflight", "ALMASat-1", "Aeneas (satellite)", "AeroCube 4", "AeroCube 4A", "AeroCube 4B", "Apsis", "Apstar 7", "Astra 2F", "BelKA-2", "Bolivarian Agency for Space Activities", "CINEMA 1", "CP5 (satellite)", "CXBN", "Caracas", "Celestis", "ChinaSat 12", "ChinaSat 2A", "China Academy of Space Technology", "China Great Wall Industry Corporation", "Chinese space programme", "Colorado Student Space Weather Experiment", "Compass-G5", "Compass-M3", "Compass-M4", "Compass-M5", "Compass-M6", "Compass G6", "David (satellite)", "E-st@r", "Earth observation satellite", "EchoStar XVI", "EchoStar XVII", "Edoardo Amaldi ATV", "Ekspress-MD2", "El Sombrero", "Epoch (astronomy)", "Eutelsat 21B", "Eutelsat 70B", "ExactView-1", "F-1 (satellite)", "Fajr (satellite)", "Fengniao 1", "Fengniao 1A", "Fengyun 2-07", "Francisco de Miranda", "GSAT-10", "Geocentric orbit", "Goliat", "Gonets-M", "Ground station", "Ground track", "Guárico", "Göktürk-2", "HYLAS 2", "Horyu 2", "Huanjing 1C", "Intelsat 19", "Intelsat 20", "Intelsat 21", "Intelsat 22", "Intelsat 23", "International Designator", "International designator", "JCSAT-13", "Jiuquan Launch Area 4", "Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center", "Kanopus-V1", "Kompsat 3", "Kosmos 2479", "Kosmos 2480", "Kosmos 2481", "Kounotori 3", "Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3", "Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 Unit 2", "LARES (satellite)", "Long March 2D", "Low Earth orbit", "Luch 5B", "MRESINS", "MSG-3", "MUOS-1", "MaSat-1", "Meridian 6", "MetOp", "Mexsat-3", "Multispectral", "Navid (satellite)", "Nimiq 6", "Niwaka", "NuSTAR", "Orbcomm (satellite)", "Orbital eccentricity", "Orbital inclination", "Orbital period", "PROITERES", "PW-Sat", "Panchromatic", "Pleiades (satellite)", "Progress M-14M", "Progress M-15M", "Progress M-16M", "Progress M-17M", "RISAT-1", "ROBUSTA", "Raiko", "Re (satellite)", "Remote sensing", "SDS-4", "SES-4", "SES-5", "SMDC-ONE 1.1", "SMDC-ONE 1.2", "SPOT 6", "Satellite Catalog Number", "Satellite bus", "Sfera-53", "Shenzhou 9", "Shijian IX-01", "Shijian IX-02", "Shizuku (satellite)", "Sif (satellite)", "Skynet 5D", "Soyuz TMA-04M", "Soyuz TMA-05M", "Soyuz TMA-06M", "Soyuz TMA-07M", "Space.com", "SpaceX COTS Demo Flight 2", "SpaceX CRS-1", "Star One C3", "TET-1", "TechEdSat", "Telkom-3", "Tianhui 1B", "Tianlian I-03", "Tiantuo 1", "USA-233", "USA-234", "USA-235", "USA-236", "USA-237", "USA-238", "USA-239", "USA-240", "USD", "UniCubeSat-GG", "United States Space Command", "VRSS-2", "Van Allen Probes", "Venesat-1", "Venezuela", "VesselSat-2", "Vinasat-2", "We-Wish", "Xatcobeo", "Xinyan 1", "YahSat-1B", "Yamal-300K", "Yamal-402", "Yaogan", "Yaogan 14", "Yaogan 15", "Yaogan 16A", "Yaogan 16B", "Yaogan 16C", "Yubeliny 2", "Ziyuan III-01", "Zond-PP"]}
