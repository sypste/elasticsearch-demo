Small spots appear between leaf veins, elongate, then turn yellow-brown and become pale. The disease appears most often on seedling leaves during the autumn, but also affects adult plants.\n\n\n== Economic Impact ==\nSevere attacks of Septoria Secalis can result in crop yield losses between 10% and 40%. Common control measures include crop rotation, the ploughing of plant debris, and fungicidal treatment of affected plants.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",
