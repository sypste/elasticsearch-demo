    "content": "High Kick: Revenge of the Short Legged (Korean: 하이킥! : 짧은 다리의 역습; RR: Haikik: Jjalbeun Dariui Yeokseup) was a South Korean sitcom that aired from 2011 to 2012. Revolving around the lives of the Ahn family and their neighbors, it explored the lives of people who are down and out and how they manage to recover.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe story begins in 2041, where Lee Juck has released a best selling novel called \"High Kick: Revenge of the Short-legged\". The book describes his experience with the Ahn's and Ji-won's households, the primary plot being the Ahn family's financial hardship. The story is narrated by Lee Juck himself.\nThe drama begins when Nae-sang's business partner, who has embezzled funds from the company, flees the country and leaves behind a mountain of debts and a horde of angry creditors. Faced with the prospect of going to debtors' prison, Nae-sang frantically collects his family (his wife in the middle of a massage session, his son during an ice hockey match and his daughter who had just arrived from LA) and escapes to the countryside.\nRendered both bankrupt and homeless, the family has no place to stay for the night after Nae Sang's plans to live with his great uncle fall through (the old man has died and sold his house). In desperation, they call Yoo Sun's younger brother, Kye-sang. They decide to move into the house he shares with Ji-seok, Yoo-sun's other younger brother.\nThe series follows several subplots through to their conclusion; the relationship between Ha-sun and Ji-seok, Jin-hee's search for a stable career, the one-sided love triangle between Ji-won, Jin-hee, and Kye-sang, and Jong-seok's unrequited love for Ji-won.\n\n\n== Characters ==\nMost characters use the actor's real name (with the exception of surnames).\n\n\n=== The Ahn/Yoon house ===\nAhn Nae-sang (안내상, Ahn Nae-sang)\nThe head of the Ahn family. Nae Sang was scammed by a close friend out of a large sum of money. As a result, his company, Ahn Special Effects, became bankrupt, and he went on the run from his creditors. He tends to be calculating, hot-tempered, and tends to be viewed as self-centered due to his massive pride, but ultimately cares for his family. He quarrels often with his wife, although they enjoy a good relationship together. Later in the series, he develops Ahn Arts, an extra casting company, and later managed to build Ahn's World from money they won as second place in the lottery.Yoon Yoo-sun (윤유선, Yoon Yoo-sun)\nAhn Nae-sang's wife.

He is a doctor at a local community health center, previously working at a general hospital. He is cheerful, kind, and selfless, but sometimes obtuse about other people's feelings. He wears a perpetual smile on his face, even when sleeping. He always jokes around and say 농담입니다 (Nongdam-imnida) or \"just kidding\" while shaking his head. He demonstrates a strong sense of philanthropy, willing to help the less fortunate during his spare time, and ultimately wanted to go to Rwanda on a volunteer trip near the end of the series.Yoon Ji-seok (윤지석, Seo Ji-seok)\nYounger brother of Yoo-sun and Kye-sang.

She loves to ride her scooter even though her elders disapprove because of her narcolepsy.
