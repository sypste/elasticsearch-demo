    "content": "The Vortech Kestrel Jet is an American tip-jet helicopter that was designed in the 1980s. Kits for amateur construction were originally provided by Vortech and plans remain available.\n\n\n== Design and development ==\nThe aircraft was designed to fit into the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles rules, including the category's maximum empty weight of 254 lb (115 kg). The aircraft has a standard empty weight of 175 lb (79 kg). It features a single main rotor, a single-seat open cockpit without a windshield and skid landing gear. Power is supplied by two G8-2-20 rotor tip jets that run on propane, consuming 12 U.S. gallons (45 L; 10.0 imp gal) per hour and producing 47 lb (21 kg) of thrust each.The aircraft fuselage is made from bolted-together aluminum tubing. Its main rotor is 24 ft (7.3 m) in diameter. Due to the lack of torque produced there is no tail rotor and instead the Kestrel mounts a circular-shaped rudder for directional control. Controls consist only of cyclic, rudder and throttle.\n\n\n== Specifications (Kestrel Jet) ==\nData from Cliche, Vortech and KitPlanesGeneral characteristics\nCrew: one\nLength: 12 ft 0 in (3.66 m)\nHeight: 7 ft 0 in (2.13 m)\nEmpty weight: 180 lb (82 kg)\nGross weight: 440 lb (200 kg)\nFuel capacity: 10 U.S. gallons (38 L; 8.3 imp gal) of propane\nPowerplant: 2 Ã— G8-2-20 rotor tip-mounted jet engines, 47 lb (21 kg) of thrust\nMain rotor diameter:  25 ft 0 in (7.62 m)\nMain rotor area: 491 sq ft (45.6 m2)Performance\n\nMaximum speed: 63 mph (101 km/h, 55 kn)\nCruise speed: 45 mph (72 km/h, 39 kn)\nRange: 60 mi (97 km, 52 nmi)\nService ceiling: 12,500 ft (3,800 m)\nRate of climb: 900 ft/min (4.6 m/s)\nDisk loading: 0.90 lb/sq ft (4.4 kg/m2)Avionics\nnone\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",
