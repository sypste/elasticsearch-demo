Its relatively small population qualifies this species to be categorized as a \"Vulnerable\" one. While hunting poses somewhat of a threat to the Flores green pigeon, its primary threat remains as the loss of habitat due to the burning of vegetation during the dry season.", "content": "The Flores green pigeon (Treron floris) is a species of bird in the family Columbidae.
