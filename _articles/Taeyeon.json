She has received various awards and nominations, including six Golden Disc Awards, five Seoul Music Awards, four Gaon Chart Music Awards, three Melon Music Awards, and three Mnet Asian Music Awards.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\n\n\n=== 1989–2008: Early life and career beginnings ===\n\nTaeyeon was born on March 9, 1989, in Jeonju, South Korea. Her family consists of her parents, an older brother, and a younger sister Kim Hayeon, who made her solo debut in 2020. Having believed that she was \"only talented\" at singing, Taeyeon harbored the dream of becoming a singer at a young age. During her second year in middle school, Taeyeon accompanied her father to SM Academy (a former music institution and auxiliary affiliation of SM Entertainment), to pursue vocal lessons. Although at the time her father did not encourage Taeyeon to become an entertainer, he was persuaded by the school's principal to give his daughter a chance after she recognized Taeyeon's \"clean\" voice. During the next year, Taeyeon accompanied her father from their hometown to Seoul on every Sunday to receive her vocal lessons from The One. She named BoA, Whitney Houston and Hikaru Utada as her pre-debut inspirations.Taeyeon was trained by her former vocal instructor, known professionally as The One, for three years. In a 2011 interview, he described Taeyeon as a \"smart\" student, someone \"unlike others who came to him with dreams of becoming a celebrity... [she] wanted to be a singer and reach the top with her own talents.\" In 2004, he \"wanted to acknowledge Taeyeon's potential\" by giving her the chance to be in his song \"You Bring Me Joy\". That same year, she won first place at the SM Youth Best Competition and signed a contract with SM Entertainment. The training process was so tough that it nearly made her quit at one point; she continued, however, and debuted as a member of girl group Girls' Generation in August 2007. Years later, both the president of SM Academy and The One named Taeyeon as one of their most memorable students.Taeyeon graduated from Jeonju Art High School and was awarded the school's Lifetime Achievement Award in 2008.\n\n\n=== 2008–2015: Original soundtracks, TTS and SM The Ballad ===\n\nTaeyeon sang \"7989\" (featuring Kangta), a track taken from both Girls' Generation's eponymous debut album (2007) and Kangta's fourth studio album, Eternity (2008). After that, Taeyeon gained popularity through her various television soundtracks, recording \"If\" for the KBS2 drama Hong Gil Dong (2008) and \"Can You Hear Me\" for MBC's drama Beethoven Virus (2009). \"If\" was seen as more popular than its respective drama, and \"Can You Hear Me\" won a Popularity Award at the 2008 Golden Disk Awards. Both tracks remain among Taeyeon's most well-known hits. During this period, she also recorded \"It's Love\", a duet with Girls' Generation member Sunny, for the MBC drama Heading to the Ground (2009).Following a radio hosting job in 2009–10, Taeyeon tried out acting, making her theatrical debut in a lead role in the 2010 musical A Song to the Sun. She played the part of Kaoru Amane, a teenager who suffered from xeroderma pigmentosum, and learned to play a guitar for the role. Her performance in the sold-out shows received good press despite the musical's critical reviews. Jang Gyeong-jin of 10Asia praised Taeyeon's \"distinct vocals\" and commented that her acting stood out among idol stars who had ventured into musical theatre, while Kim Ji-yeong from The Dong-a Ilbo felt \"Taeyeon's optimistic and charming personality made her the perfect match\" for the role. Despite the favorable response, Taeyeon later described musicals as difficult, citing that her weak concentration made it hard for her to act and sing at the same time.\n\nThe same year, Taeyeon worked with Korean songwriter-composer Ahn Young-min on her musical projects. She recorded \"Like A Star\" (featuring The One), and the song reached number one on the Gaon Digital Chart. Her next single, \"I Love You\", for the SBS drama Athena: Goddess of War soundtrack, reached number two on the same chart. Ahn recalled his impression of the latter song: \"I was surprised at how well Taeyeon could sing. This is a rather mature song, so I would be lying if I said I didn't have my doubts, but she blew me away. I was moved to tears listening to her singing.\" In 2011, Taeyeon lent her voice to Kim Bum-soo's \"Different\", a single featured on his seventh album Solista: Part 2. The song debuted at number two on the Gaon Digital Chart. Taeyeon and Kim Bum-soo met again at his concert two years later for a live cover version of the latter's 2008 song \"Man and Woman\".Following Taeyeon's working relationship with him from the drama Beethoven Virus (2008), musical director Lee Pil-ho was determined to collaborate with her again on the soundtrack for MBC's melodrama The King 2 Hearts (2012) soundtrack, having her record the main theme song \"Missing You Like Crazy\". It was released in March 2012 and debuted at number two on both the Gaon Digital Chart and K-pop Hot 100. Taeyeon's vocal received positive feedback from the song's composer Park Hae-woon: \"She fully understood the song in its entirety and expressed each detail very precisely...even though this song requires the lowest note that a female singer can produce, Taeyeon executed them perfectly.\" The song was named the most popular soundtrack at 2012 Seoul Drama Awards. Later in the year, she contributed her vocals to the song \"Closer\", for the SBS drama To the Beautiful You, which was number seven on both the Gaon Digital Chart and K-pop Hot 100.In April 2012, a Girls' Generation subgroup named TTS was formed with Taeyeon and fellow members Tiffany and Seohyun.

Two months later, she recorded \"And One\", written and composed by Kangta, for the SBS drama That Winter, The Wind Blows. It debuted at the top of Billboard's K-pop Hot 100 and reached number two on the Gaon Digital Chart. In July 2013, Taeyeon was invited to record the theme song \"Bye\" for the movie Mr. Go soundtrack, after its musical director was left with a \"deep impression\" having heard her cover version of a song during a radio appearance.In February 2014, Taeyeon joined the roster of SM the Ballad, a ballad group initially formed by SM Entertainment in 2010, contributing her vocals to their second album Breath.
