It is commonly used against Plasmopara viticola, Alternaria solani, Phytophthora infestans, and Septoria nodorum.\n\n\n== Molecular interaction ==\nFamoxadone is of lesser interaction strength at the Qp pocket than some other QoIs, for example, azoxystrobin. This is because azoxystrobin and such interact more centrally in the Qp pocket than does famoxadone.\n\n\n== Resistance management ==\nAlthough it has a different chemistry, famoxadone shows full cross-resistance with the rest of the main FRAC group 11 that it belongs to, which is almost entirely strobs. It has not shown cross-resistance with the 11A subgroup however. As with all QoIs there is a high risk of resistance development and so pesticide stewardship is important.Populations of P. infestans and A. solani in northern and western Europe are not known to be resistant to famoxadone.\n\n\n== External links ==\nFamoxadone in the Pesticide Properties DataBase (PPDB)\n\n\n== References ==", "links": ["Alternaria solani", "Annual Review of Biochemistry", "Annual Review of Phytopathology", "Annual Reviews (publisher)", "Azoxystrobin", "CAS Registry Number", "ChEBI", "ChEMBL", "ChemSpider", "Chemical formula", "Chemical nomenclature", "CompTox Chemicals Dashboard", "Cucurbitaceae", "Cymoxanil", "Doi (identifier)", "ECHA InfoCard", "Famoxadone (data page)", "Fungicide", "Fungicide Resistance Action Committee", "Grape", "ISBN (identifier)", "ISSN (identifier)", "International Chemical Identifier", "JSmol", "Lettuce", "Molar mass", "Northern Europe", "Organic compound", "Oxazolidine-dione", "Pesticide stewardship", "Phytophthora infestans", "Plasmopara viticola", "Potato", "PubChem", "QoI", "Qp pocket", "Septoria nodorum", "Simplified molecular-input line-entry system", "Standard state", "Tomato", "Unique Ingredient Identifier", "United States Environmental Protection Agency", "Western Europe"]}
