An accompanying music video for the track was released on Vevo on April 6, 2012.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\"Beez in the Trap\" was written by Minaj, Maurice Jordan, and 2 Chainz, while production was handled by Kenoe. It was recorded at Conway Studios in Los Angeles, California by Ariel Chabaz and Finis \"KY\" White with assistance from Jon Sher. Mixing of the song was done by Chabaz with additional help from Sher at Conway Studios. Originally, Kenoe began sending both pop and hip-hop songs to Minaj when he heard that production of her sophomore album had begun. Later that same day, Minaj's A&R Mack Maine informed him that she was looking for \"some rap shit\", so he submitted more aggressive, urban songs in hopes of inclusion on the record. Kenoe said that the song's musical concept was simplicity as he didn't want \"a million and one things going on in it\", and credited it as being distinctive from the others included on the album. The song premiered on DJ Flex's radio show at Hot 97 on March 20, 2012. In an interview with Graham Norton, Minaj stated \"It just means, 'I am always...' you know, that's our slang way of saying, 'I beez doing such-and-such-and-such.' So it's really like, 'I am always in the trap.' Now, the trap, ladies and gentlemen, relates to anywhere where you get your money.\"\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\"Beez in the Trap\" is an electro-hop and hardcore hip-hop slow jam set in common time. The music is built around a spacious and echoed beat, complemented by sparse hollow drums, and heavy-bass. Its permutable soundscape incorporates a retro 1980s gangsta rap production, which consists of effects such as finger-snaps, sparse instrumentation, ricocheting sonar blips, \"drip drip\" synths, and features elements of dubstep and grime music.The song's musical structure is characterized by its ultra minimalistic production, devoid of any hooks and often veering on nothing but empty space, with the exception of a \"bubble-pop\" beat and a \"growling\" sub-bass.   Throughout \"Beez in the Trap\", Minaj changes and adapts her vocal delivery to specific areas of the song. During the verses and bridge, her vocals are \"biting and caustic\", while in the choruses, her vocals are \"matter-of-fact and almost bubbly\" according to Jessica Sager of Popcrush. Calling it trap song, Nathan S of the music review site DJ Booth said Minaj \"put aside her usually schizophrenic rhyme style in favor of a mellow, almost spoken style.\"\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe song received generally mixed reviews. Although he felt that the song \"lack[ed] real substance\", Adam Fleischer of XXL praised \"Beez in the Trap\", calling it a \"memorable moment\" of Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded, and also complimented Minaj's \"unique energy and distinct personality\" displayed in the song. Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media described \"Beez in the Trap\" as an \"effortless, pinging schoolyard taunt\", and, in a separate review of the song for the same publication, Carrie Battan complimented Minaj's \"daunting swagger\", writing that she \"hits a spot sweet enough to render every single gripe obsolete for four and a half minutes\". In her review of Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded for The A.V. Club, Genevieve Koski described Minaj's performance as \"relatively sedate but incredibly sharp\": she called the song's production \"spare\" and \"sonar-blip\", and noted Minaj to be \"at her most verbose\" during the first six songs of the album.Tom Ewing, writing for The Guardian, felt \"Beez in the Trap\" showed Minaj's awareness of her \"divided fanbase\": he noted that whilst Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded contained songs that were \"precision-tooled for the modern pop environment\", \"Beez in the Trap\" places more emphasis on Minaj's rapping ability, writing that the song \"throw[s] a bone to the listeners who just want to hear her rap\". Rob Markman of MTV News commended the performance of 2 Chainz, calling his verse in the song \"charismatic\", and went on to write that he \"doesn't compromise a thing spitting alongside the multiplatinum rapper\". No Ripcord stated that \"I Am Your Leader and Beez In The Trap are thrilling and make good use of cameos\". Slant Magazine stated that \"I Am Your Leader and Beez in the Trap [are] two excellent tracks which manage to sound both bubbly and heavy as Minaj delivers her most effortlessly entertaining shit-talk to date\".Complex named the song No. 9 on their list of the best 50 songs of 2012, while Pitchfork Media ranked it No. 18. Rolling Stone ranked it as the 44th best song of the 2010s decade.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nMinaj filmed the official music video for \"Beez in the Trap\" on March 18, 2012 in Miami.
