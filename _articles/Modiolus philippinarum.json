These shells are thin but solid, swollen, elongate-ovate and roughly trapeziform. The anterior margin is short, while posterodorsal margin is long and oblique in relation to the ventral margin. Hind margin is convex and hinge-line is approximately one half the total length. Outer surface of the shell shows many concentric growth striae. The basic color of the external surface is yellowish brown, while the interior varies from pearly white to purplish red.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThis species is present in the Red Sea, Madagascar and Indo-Pacific, from eastern Africa, to eastern Indonesia; north to Japan and south to Queensland and Western Australia. It inhabits sublittoral muds, at depth of 0-40m.\n\n\n== References ==", "links": ["Animal", "Australian Faunal Directory", "Barcode of Life Data System", "Binomial nomenclature", "Bivalve", "Bivalve shell", "Bivalvia", "Family (biology)", "Fossilworks", "Global Biodiversity Information Facility", "INaturalist", "Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera", "Marine (ocean)", "Modiolus (bivalve)", "Mollusc", "Mollusca", "Mussel", "Mytilida", "Mytilidae", "National Center for Biotechnology Information", "SeaLifeBase", "Species", "Sylvanus Charles Thorp Hanley", "Synonym (taxonomy)", "Taxonomy (biology)", "Wikidata", "World Register of Marine Species"]}
