While this LP includes three new songs (\"All I Ever Need\", \"I Wrote a Symphony on My Guitar\", and the hit pairing with Deniece Williams, \"Too Much, Too Little, Too Late\"), it doesn’t stray too far from the format of his albums of recent years in covering established material, including a standard (\"Where or When\"), a country number (\"It Was Almost Like a Song\"), something from Broadway (\"If You Believe\"), and a few soundtrack tunes (the title track, \"How Deep Is Your Love\", \"Till Love Touches Your Life\").\nThe album made its first appearance on Billboard magazine's Top LP's & Tapes chart in the issue dated April 1, 1978, and remained there for 24 weeks, peaking at number 9 while in the meantime receiving Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America on May 2 and Platinum certification two months later, on July 6.
