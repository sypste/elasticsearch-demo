Bududa is the chief town of the district.", "content": "Bududa District is a district in the Eastern Region of Uganda. Bududa is the chief town of the district.\n\n\n== Location ==\nBududa District is bordered by Sironko District to the north, Kenya to the east, Manafwa District to the south, and Mbale District to the west. The district headquarters at Bududa are located approximately 36 kilometres (22 mi), by road, south-east of Mbale, the largest city in the sub-region.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nBududa District was created by Act of the Ugandan Parliament in 2010. Before then, the district was part of Mbale District.\n\n\n== Population ==\nIn 1991, the national population census estimated the district population at 79,200. During the 2002 national census, the population was estimated at 123,100, with an annual growth rate of 4 percent. In 2012, the population of the district was estimated at 180,600.

It was a market day at Bukigai. Many people had returned from the market place and they were relaxing and drinking at Naposhi trading centre when the Bukalasi mudslide suddenly came with water, mud and other debris and deposited them in the trading centre.  It is hard to classify this disaster. Is it a flood? Is it a mudslide? Or is it a combination of the two? The disaster attracted immediate attention from the government. For example, the Minister for Disaster Preparedness, Hon. Hillary Onek came and Muwoya Wekhoola David being the District Inspector of Schools led the team to Sume Junior School which had been badly damaged.  President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni himself came, went to Naposhi and consoled the people who had gathered at Bukalasi playground.
