The film's supporting roles included Michael Moriarty, Valentina Cervi, Enrico Colantoni, and Edward Herrmann.\\nThe biopic began development at Warner Bros. in the early 1990s. At one point, Michael Mann was contracted to direct with Leonardo DiCaprio starring in the lead role. After Mann's departure, Des McAnuff, Dennis Hopper, and Milčo Mančevski were considered for the director's chair. Rydell was hired as director in 1996, but the film continued to languish in development hell.\\nWarner Bros. then decided to produce James Dean as a TV movie for Turner Network Television (TNT); both Warners and TNT are owned by Time Warner. Franco was cast as Dean in May 2000 after a search that resulted in 500 auditions. Franco researched his role to closely portray Dean.

Jordan is the principal owner and chairman of the Charlotte Hornets of the NBA and of 23XI Racing in the NASCAR Cup Series. He was integral in popularizing the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s, becoming a global cultural icon in the process.Jordan played college basketball for three seasons under coach Dean Smith with the North Carolina Tar Heels. As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels\\' national championship team in 1982. Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick, and quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a reputation as one of the game\\'s best defensive players. His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free-throw line in Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames \"Air Jordan\" and \"His Airness\". Jordan won his first NBA title with the Bulls in 1991, and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a three-peat. Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the 1993–94 NBA season to play Minor League Baseball but returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three more championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular season wins in the 1995–96 NBA season. He retired for the second time in January 1999 but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Washington Wizards.Jordan\\'s individual accolades and accomplishments include six NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards, ten NBA scoring titles (both all-time records), five NBA MVP awards, ten All-NBA First Team designations, nine All-Defensive First Team honors, fourteen NBA All-Star Game selections, three NBA All-Star Game MVP awards, three NBA steals titles, and the 1988 NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award. He holds the NBA records for career regular season scoring average (30.12 points per game) and career playoff scoring average (33.45 points per game). In 1999, he was named the 20th century\\'s greatest North American athlete by ESPN, and was second to Babe Ruth on the Associated Press\\' list of athletes of the century. Jordan was twice inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, once in 2009 for his individual career, and again in 2010 as part of the 1992 United States men\\'s Olympic basketball team (\"The Dream Team\"). He became a member of the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 2009, a member of the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in 2010, and an individual member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2015 and a \"Dream Team\" member in 2017.One of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation, Jordan is known for his product endorsements. He fueled the success of Nike\\'s Air Jordan sneakers, which were introduced in 1984 and remain popular today. Jordan also starred as himself in the 1996 live-action animation hybrid film Space Jam and is the central focus of the Emmy Award-winning documentary miniseries The Last Dance (2020). He became part-owner and head of basketball operations for the Charlotte Bobcats (now named the Hornets) in 2006, and bought a controlling interest in 2010.

Hertz.In 1920 the Yellow Cab Manufacturing Company was formed to manufacture taxicabs.\\nDuring the 1910s and 1920s the company was involved in considerable illegal activity relating to mobsters and in particular to the Chicago Outfit. Yellow Cab was involved in a bitter rivalry with Checker Taxi at the time which led to a number of shootings, deaths, and firebombings.By 1925 the company was a subsidiary of the Chicago Yellow Cab Company, a public holding company with shares equally divided between Hertz, Parmelee, and a small group of other investors. Hertz sold the Yellow Cab Manufacturing Company to General Motors in 1925.He sold his remaining interest in the Yellow Cab Company in 1929 to Morris Markin, who had established Checker Cab Manufacturing Company as a driver cooperative with the Checker Taxi. Hertz had decided to focus on car rentals (later Hertz Rent-a-Car which incidentally still uses a yellow logo). The sale was also prompted by the violence associated with the business that culminated in 1928 in his racing stables being destroyed in a $200,000 fire in which 11 thoroughbred horses were burned.From 1930 till 1982 Yellow Cab of Chicago sourced all of their operating taxicab fleet from Markin's Checker Motors Corp. of Kalamazoo, Michigan.  Holding a near monopoly of taxicab operations in Chicago, the majority of Chicago taxicabs were largely purpose built Checker Cabs spanning three generations.\\nYellow Cab Co. was sold again in 1996 to Patton Corrigan, who in turn sold controlling interest in 2005 to Michael Levine, a third-generation taxicab operator from New York City. The Levine/Corrigan group has also purchased the Checker Taxi Affiliation in Chicago, to reunite the two companies once again. In 2015, Yellow Cab of Chicago filed for bankruptcy. Yellow Cab Co eventually split into multiple companies across the nation bearing the Yellow Cab name. In January 2016, San Francisco's Yellow Cab cooperative filed for bankruptcy protection.\\n\\n\"},\n",

    "Another very useful feature for development purposes are [`runtime_fields`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/runtime.html). Normally, as we have done so far, the fields of an index should be declared before the _ingest_ of data, that is before any data are loaded into Elasticsearch. Alternatively, fields can be added on an existing index, which is then refreshed to perform the defined analysis on the documents, until which the field is not usable. `runtime_fields` allow a different approach: The value of the field is determined during `runtime`, i.e. when the data are already being queried or analyzed. The value of the `runtime_field` can be set by providing a script through the search API or by adding it manually through Kibana. Let's have a look."

    "Now let's get a little more fancy. As stated above, plugins and extensions are a part of the Elastic stack as well. [OpenNLP](https://opennlp.apache.org/) is a Machine Learning (ML)-based framework for the processing of natural text and can be utilized for various tasks, among others for named entity recognition (NER). Elasticsearch can be configured to load trained ML models to perform analysis on ingested text. To do this you need to first [load the plugin](https://github.com/spinscale/elasticsearch-ingest-opennlp) and the necessary ML models into Elasticsearch by downloading both and then configuring the service to utilize the model files.\n",
