The road was previously known as Horse and Jockey Road (or Lane), after the Horse and Jockey Inn, formerly on the corner with Woodstock Road. It then became known as St John's Road, after St John's College, but there was some confusion with St John Street to the south, so at the request of residents it was given its current name in 1961. St Bernard's College, a former Cistercian institution that was closed in 1539 after the Dissolution of the Monasteries, was the name of the college from which St John's College developed.\nSome houses were demolished to make way for the St John's College development of Arthur Garrard Close off St Bernard's Road, named after the bursar at the College from 1949â€“67.\n\n\n== References ==",
