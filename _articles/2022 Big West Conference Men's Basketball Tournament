UC San Diego is ineligible for this year's tournament, as they are in the second year of the four-year transition required for teams transferring to Division I from Division II. Teams were seeded by record within the conference, with a tiebreaker system to seed teams with identical conference records. Unlike previous years, reseeding teams after the quarterfinals will not take place for this year's tournament.\n\n\n== Schedule and results ==\n\n\n== Bracket ==\n\n\n== References ==",
