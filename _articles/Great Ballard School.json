It was founded in 1924 and set up at its current location in Eartham, near Chichester, West Sussex, England, in 1961.  The headmaster is Matthew King.\n\n\n== Eartham House ==\nThe school's main building, Eartham House, was originally built in 1800 and was occupied by the poet William Hayley. The house was subsequently purchased by William Huskisson, a prominent nineteenth-century politician who was a member of parliament for Chichester and served in the governments of Lord Liverpool and the Duke of Wellington. Huskisson, despite his high-profile political career, is best remembered for the tragic manner of his death – he was run over by George Stephenson's locomotive engine The Rocket at the opening of the Liverpool to Manchester railway line in 1830.Eartham House was entirely rebuilt in 1905 to designs by the architect Edwin Lutyens, but some Regency decorations and fireplaces are still retained in one room. The house was listed as a Grade II listed building by the Ministry of Works in 1958.\n\n\n== School history ==\nSince its founding, the school has had many homes, including the original site at New Milton Hampshire. It remained there until the Second World War, when it was relocated to Dorset and then to Stowell Park in Gloucestershire, where it stayed until 1947. For a short time it was then at Cordwalles, Camberley, Surrey, where the Queen had carried out her ATS training, until a fire forced a temporary return to Stowell Park. After repairs, the school remained in Camberley until moving to its current location in 1961, chosen because the area around its home at Camberley had become more urbanised.\nIn the autumn term of 2009, the Great Ballard School began \"hosting a group of pupils from Fang Cao Di International School in Beijing, China, who have been experiencing British teaching methods as well as sharing knowledge of their own culture\". The exchange students participated in the normal class schedule and were also taken on a number of field trips to famous British locations, including Windsor Castle and Stonehenge.\n\n\n== Curriculum ==\nThough children from the ages of two and a half to sixteen attend the school, Great Ballard School has a wide number of class subjects, including \"ICT, technology, art & design, PE, music and drama\". The focus during the school year is to make the students prepared for the Common Entrance Examination and for other scholarship examinations that the students will be taking at age 13. While many of the students under the age of seven take classes such as \"music and movement, drama, PE, swimming, computing, and cooking\", it is at the age of seven that the \"prep school\" classes start.\n\n\n== Notable alumni ==\nJulien Fountain, cricketer and baseball player\nRichard Meredith, author\nHoneysuckle Weeks, actress\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSchool website", "links": ["Angmering School", "Ardingly College", "Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington", "Auxiliary Territorial Service", "Beijing, China", "Bishop Luffa School", "Bohunt Horsham", "Bohunt School Worthing", "Boundstone Community College", "Bourne Community College", "Brambletye School", "Burgess Hill Girls", "Camberley", "Chichester", "Chichester College", "Chichester Free School", "Chichester High School", "Chichester High School For Boys", "Christ's Hospital", "Common Entrance Examination", "Cottesmore School", "Crawley", "Crawley College", "Davison High School", "Department for Education", "Discovery New School", "Dorset", "Dorset House School", "Downlands Community School", "Durrington High School", "Eartham", "Edwin Lutyens", "Elizabeth II", "Farlington School", "Felpham Community College", "Forest School, Horsham", "Geographic coordinate system", "George Stephenson", "Gloucestershire", "Great Walstead School", "Hampshire", "Handcross Park School", "Hazelwick School", "Historic England", "Holy Trinity School, Crawley", "Honeysuckle Weeks", "Hurstpierpoint College", "ISBN (identifier)", "ISNI (identifier)", "Ifield Community College", "Imberhorne School", "Independent school", "Information and communications technology", "Julien Fountain", "Kings Manor Community College", "Lancing College", "Lavant House", "List of schools in West Sussex", "Listed building", "Midhurst Grammar School", "Midhurst Intermediate School", "Midhurst Rother College", "Millais School", "Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)", "Mixed-sex education", "National Heritage List for England", "New Milton", "Newells Preparatory School", "Northbrook College", "Oak Grove College", "Oathall Community College", "Oriel High School", "Ormiston Six Villages Academy", "Our Lady of Sion School", "Oxford University Press", "Palatine School", "Richard Meredith (author)", "Rikkyo School in England", "Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool", "Rydon Community College", "Sackville School, East Grinstead", "Seaford College", "Shoreham Academy", "Shoreham College", "Sir Robert Woodard Academy", "Sompting Abbotts Preparatory School", "St Andrew's High School, Worthing", "St Margaret's Convent, Midhurst", "St Oscar Romero Catholic School", "St Paul's Catholic College", "St Philip Howard Catholic High School", "St Wilfrid's Catholic School", "Staff writer", "Stephenson's Rocket", "Steyning Grammar School", "Stoke Brunswick School", "Stonehenge", "Stowell Park", "Surrey", "Tanbridge House School", "Tavistock and Summerhill School", "The Academy, Selsey", "The Burgess Hill Academy", "The College of Richard Collyer", "The Gatwick School", "The Littlehampton Academy", "The Prebendal School", "The Regis School", "The Weald School", "Thomas Bennett Community College", "Towers Convent School", "Warden Park Secondary Academy", "West Sussex", "Westbourne House School", "William Hayley", "William Huskisson", "Windlesham House School", "Windsor Castle", "Worth School", "Worthing College", "Worthing High School, West Sussex"]}
