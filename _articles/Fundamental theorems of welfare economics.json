He is in this, as in many other ways, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention... By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.Note that Smith's ideas were not directed towards welfare economics specifically, as this field of economics had not been created at the time. However, his arguments have been credited towards the creation of the branch as well as the fundamental theories of welfare economics.\n\n\n=== Léon Walras (1870) ===\nWalras wrote that 'exchange under free competition is an operation by which all parties obtain the maximum satisfaction subject to buying and selling at a uniform price'.\n\n\n=== F. Y. Edgeworth (1881) ===\nEdgeworth took a step towards the first fundamental theorem in his 'Mathematical Psychics', looking at a pure exchange economy with no production. He included imperfect competition in his analysis. His definition of equilibrium is almost the same as Pareto's later definition of optimality: it is a point such that...\n\nin whatever direction we take an infinitely small step, P and Π [the utilities of buyer and seller] do not increase together, but that, while one increases, the other decreases.\nInstead of concluding that equilibrium was Pareto optimal, Edgeworth concluded that the equilibrium maximizes the sum of utilities of the parties, which is a special case of Pareto efficiency:\n\nIt seems to follow on general dynamical principles applied to this special case that equilibrium is attained when the total pleasure-energy of the contractors is a maximum relative, or subject, to conditions...\n\n\n=== Vilfredo Pareto (1906/9) ===\nPareto stated the first fundamental theorem in his Manuale (1906) and with more rigour in its French revision (Manuel, 1909). He was the first to claim optimality under his own criterion or to support the claim by convincing arguments.He defines equilibrium more abstractly than Edgeworth as a state which would maintain itself indefinitely in the absence of external pressures and shows that in an exchange economy it is the point at which a common tangent to the parties' indifference curves passes through the endowment.His definition of optimality is given in Chap. VI:\n\nWe will say that the members of a collectivity enjoy a maximum of ophelimity [i.e. of utility] at a certain position when it is impossible to move a small step away such that the ophelimity enjoyed by each individual in the collectivity increases, or such that it diminishes. [He has previously defined an increase in individual ophelimity as a move onto a higher indifference curve.] That is to say that any small step is bound to increase the ophelimity of some individuals while diminishing that of others.\nThe following paragraph gives us a theorem:\n\nFor phenomena of type I [i.e. perfect competition], when equilibrium takes place at a point of tangency of indifference curves, the members of the collectivity enjoy a maximum of ophelimity.\nHe adds that 'a rigorous proof cannot be given without the help of mathematics' and refers to his Appendix.Wicksell, referring to his definition of optimality, commented:\n\nWith such a definition it is almost self-evident that this so-called maximum obtains under free competition, because if, after an exchange is effected, it were possible by means of a further series of direct or indirect exchanges to produce an additional satisfaction of needs for the participators, then to that extent such a continued exchange would doubtless have taken place, and the original position could not be one of final equilibrium.\nPareto didn't find it so straightforward. He gives a diagrammatic argument in his text, applying solely to exchange, and a 32-page mathematical argument in the Appendix which Samuelson found 'not easy to follow'. Pareto was hampered by not having a concept of the production–possibility frontier, whose development was due partly to his collaborator Enrico Barone. His own 'indifference curves for obstacles' seem to have been a false path.\nShortly after stating the first fundamental theorem, Pareto asks a question about distribution:\n\nConsider a collectivist society which seeks to maximise the ophelimity of its members. The problem divides into two parts. Firstly we have a problem of distribution: how should the goods within a society be shared between its members? And secondly, how should production be organised so that, when goods are so distributed, the members of society obtain the maximum ophelimity?\nHis answer is an informal precursor of the second theorem:\n\nHaving distributed goods according to the answer to the first problem, the state should allow the members of the collectivity to operate a second distribution, or operate it itself, in either case making sure that it is performed in conformity with the workings of free competition.\n\n\n=== Enrico Barone (1908) ===\nBarone, an associate of Pareto, proved an optimality property of perfect competition, namely that – assuming exogenous prices – it maximises the monetary value of the return from productive activity, this being the sum of the values of leisure, savings, and goods for consumption, all taken in the desired proportions. He makes no argument that the prices chosen by the market are themselves optimal.\nHis paper wasn't translated into English until 1935. It received an approving summary from Samuelson but seems not to have influenced the development of the welfare theorems as they now stand.\n\n\n=== Abba Lerner (1934) ===\nIn 1934 Lerner restated Edgeworth's condition for exchange that indifference curves should meet as tangents, presenting it as an optimality property. He stated a similar condition for production, namely that the production–possibility frontier (PPF, to which he gave the alternative name of 'productive indifference curve') should be tangential with an indifference curve for the community. He was one of the originators of the PPF, having used it in a paper on international trade in 1932. He shows that the two arguments can be presented in the same terms, since the PPF plays the same role as the mirror-image indifference curve in an Edgeworth box. He also mentions that there's no need for the curves to be differentiable, since the same result obtains if they touch at pointed corners.\nHis definition of optimality was equivalent to Pareto's:\n\nIf... it is possible to move one individual into a preferred position without moving another individual into a worse position... we may say that the relative optimum is not reached...\nThe optimality condition for production is equivalent to the pair of requirements that (i) price should equal marginal cost and (ii) output should be maximised subject to (i). Lerner thus reduces optimality to tangency for both production and exchange, but does not say why the implied point on the PPF should be the equilibrium condition for a free market. Perhaps he considered it already sufficiently well established.Lerner ascribes to his LSE colleague Victor Edelberg the credit for suggesting the use of indifference curves. Samuelson surmised that Lerner obtained his results independently of Pareto's work.\n\n\n=== Harold Hotelling (1938) ===\nHotelling put forward a new argument to show that 'sales at marginal costs are a condition of maximum general welfare' (under Pareto's definition). He accepted that this condition was satisfied by perfect competition, but argued in consequence that perfect competition could not be optimal since some beneficial projects would be unable to recoup their fixed costs by charging at this rate (for example, in a natural monopoly).\n\n\n=== Oscar Lange (1942) ===\nLange's paper 'The Foundations of Welfare Economics' is the source of the now-traditional pairing of two theorems, one governing markets, the other distribution. He justified the Pareto definition of optimality for the first theorem by reference to Lionel Robbins's rejection of interpersonal utility comparisons, and suggested various ways to reintroduce interpersonal comparisons for the second theorem such as the adjudications of a democratically elected Congress. Lange believed that such a congress could act in a similar way to a capitalist: through setting price vectors, it could achieve any optimal production plan to have achieve efficiency and social equality.His reasoning is a mathematical translation (into Lagrange multipliers) of Lerner's graphical argument. The second theorem does not take its familiar form in his hands; rather he simply shows that the optimisation conditions for a genuine social utility function are similar to those for Pareto optimality.\n\n\n=== Abram Bergson and Paul Samuelson (1947) ===\nSamuelson (crediting Abram Bergson for the substance of his ideas) brought Lange's second welfare theorem to approximately its modern form. He follows Lange in deriving a set of equations which are necessary for Pareto optimality, and then considers what additional constraints arise if the economy is required to satisfy a genuine social welfare function, finding a further set of equations from which it follows 'that all of the action necessary to achieve a given ethical desideratum may take the form of lump sum taxes or bounties'.\n\n\n=== Kenneth Arrow and Gérard Debreu (separately, 1951) ===\nArrow's and Debreu's two papers (written independently and published almost simultaneously) sought to improve on the rigour of Lange's first theorem. Their accounts refer to (short-run) production as well as exchange, expressing the conditions for both through linear functions.\nEquilibrium for production is expressed by the constraint that the value of a manufacturer's net output, i.e. the dot product of the production vector with the price vector, should be maximised over the manufacturer's production set. This is interpreted as profit maximisation. A firm's maximum output, like that of an economy as a whole, will be attained only if an invisible hand leads employees, each seeking his or her own satisfaction, to promote an end which is no part of their intention; so like Lerner, Arrow and Debreu relied on a powerful premise (in their case embodied in definitions) to do much of the work.\nEquilibrium for exchange is interpreted as meaning that the individual's utility should be maximised over the positions obtainable from the endowment through exchange, these being the positions whose value is no greater than the value of his or her endowment, where the value of an allocation is its dot product with the price vector.\nThe concept of equilibrium is thus recast as meaning optimality along a straight price line. This new meaning is given the special name of 'Walrasian' or 'competitive equilibrium', and is not a true equilibrium condition in the sense of being a balance of forces.\nArrow's and Debreu's proofs required a change of mathematical style from the calculus to convex set theory. Arrow motivated his paper by reference to the need to extend proofs to cover equilibria at the edge of the space, and Debreu by the possibility of indifference curves being non-differentiable. Modern texts follow their style of proof.\n\n\n=== Greenwald-Stiglitz theorem ===\nIn their 1986 paper, \"Externalities in Economies with Imperfect Information and Incomplete Markets\", Bruce Greenwald and Joseph Stiglitz showed that the fundamental welfare theorems do not hold if there are incomplete markets or imperfect information. The paper establishes that a competitive equilibrium of an economy with asymmetric information is generically not even constrained Pareto efficient. A government facing the same information constraints as the private individuals in the economy can nevertheless find Pareto-improving policy interventions.Greenwald and Stiglitz noted several relevant situations, including how moral hazard may render a situation inefficient (e.g. an alcohol tax may be pareto improving as it reduces automobile accidents).\n\n\n== Proof of the first fundamental theorem ==\nThe first fundamental theorem holds under general conditions. A formal statement is as follows: If preferences are locally nonsatiated, and if \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          \n            X\n            \n              ∗\n            \n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          \n            Y\n            \n              ∗\n            \n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          p\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (\\mathbf {X^{*}} ,\\mathbf {Y^{*}} ,\\mathbf {p} )}\n   is a price equilibrium with transfers, then the allocation \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          \n            X\n            \n              ∗\n            \n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          \n            Y\n            \n              ∗\n            \n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (\\mathbf {X^{*}} ,\\mathbf {Y^{*}} )}\n  is Pareto optimal.  An equilibrium in this sense either relates to an exchange economy only or presupposes that firms are allocatively and productively efficient, which can be shown to follow from perfectly competitive factor and production markets.Given a set \n  \n    \n      \n        G\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle G}\n   of types of goods we work in the real vector space over \n  \n    \n      \n        G\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle G}\n  , \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            R\n          \n          \n            G\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{G}}\n   and use boldface for vector valued variables.
