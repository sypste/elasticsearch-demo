The present building dates from the beginning of the 19th century. The mosque complex includes a mausoleum marking the spot where Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, the standard-bearer and friend of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, is said to have been buried.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe mosque is named after Abu Ayyub al-Ansari (Eyüp Sultan in Turkish), a Companion and trusted friend of Muhammad who is believed to have died here during the first Arab siege of Constantinople in the 670s.A mosque complex (külliye) was constructed on the site in 1458 by the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II only five years after the conquest of Constantinople in 1453. Mehmed II was reportedly motivated to build the mosque after his teacher, Akşemseddin, had a dream to build a commemorative mosque at the burial place of al-Ayyub al-Ansari. When al-Ansari's tomb was found in 1458 the mosque was built next to it.In the early 18th century, Sultan Ahmed III rebuilt the two minarets of the mosque in their current form. By the end of the 18th century the mosque was in a ruinous state, perhaps as a result of earthquake damage, and in 1798 sultan Selim III ordered the whole structure other than the minarets to be pulled down and rebuilt. This work was completed in 1800. The new mosque made use of the Classical Ottoman tradition by following the \"octagonal baldaquin\" design, similar to the Sokollu Mehmed Pasha Mosque in the Azapkapı neighbourhood, but much of its decoration is in the contemporary Baroque style. The eastern minaret was rebuilt in the original style by Mahmud II in 1822.The mosque was the traditional site for the coronation ceremony of the Ottoman Sultans, where the new sultan was girded with the sword of Osman.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe word baroque characterizes and illustrates something that is dramatic, highly detailed, or complex. This artistic style started in the 1600s in Rome, Italy where it began to spread from there. After a possible earthquake, Sultan Selim III wanted to rebuild the Eyüp Sultan Mosque using this style that involves motion, drama, high-contrast architecture and design for the mosque. This particular artistic style attempted to portray an atmosphere that appealed and attracted one's emotions and senses where people could almost feel its meaning and significance. The Baroque style from different nations and cultures influenced the Ottoman Empire in many ways. The Ottoman Turks began to adapt many styles from the West and even more artistic taste from Europe where they added a bit of their culture into their new art. The Ottoman Empire were even more excited to continue their existing changes in their style after many foreigners were astonished and impressed by the new architecture, which marked an important time for change in Ottoman architecture. In addition, this time period was greatly influenced by the Baroque style not only through the Ottoman Empire but throughout the world from Europe to the Philippines. Its uniqueness and rare art was what attracted the Ottomans due to its exaggeration involved in the different pieces where people could almost see the art moving. Baroque art was exhibited in all sorts of activities and buildings including religious rituals, opera, churches, palaces, etc.\n\n\n== Religious significance ==\n\nAs a Companion of the Prophet Muhammad, Abu Ayyub al-Ansari's tomb is greatly venerated by Muslims. The mausoleum is on the north side of a courtyard opposite the main entrance to the prayer hall of the mosque. Another reason why the mosque is important for Muslims is that it holds relics believed to be personal belongings of Muhammad that have been preserved.Other important Ottoman officials and royal family members are buried in the area. One important individual's tomb who is also here belongs to Sokollu Mehmet Paşa. This person was an Ottoman vizier, or chief minister, who served in 1565 under Süleyman the Magnificent and Selim II. Sokollu Mehmet Paşa was also drafted into a child devşirme (collection or gathering in Turkish) and was ranked as one as the highest in the group.\n\n\n== Tiles ==\nThe wall of the mausoleum facing the mosque has a number of contrasting panels of Iznik tiles. They date from several different periods and were brought together during the reconstruction of mosque in 1798–1799.  The walls of the vestibule to the mausoleum are also covered in Iznik tiles. They have the characteristic sealing-wax red slip and date from around 1580. Similar tiles to those in the vestibule are displayed in several museums outside Turkey; they probably once covered the walls of the now demolished entrance hall (camekân) to the baths.The British Museum has a panel of three blue and turquoise Iznik tiles, dating from around 1550, that are similar to some of those that now decorate the external wall of the shrine.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mosques\nOttoman architecture\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAtasoy, Nurhan; Raby, Julian (1989).
