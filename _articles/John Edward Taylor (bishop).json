The first American-born bishop to head a European diocese, he was Bishop of Stockholm in Sweden from 1962 to 1976.\n\n\n== Early life and priesthood ==\nTaylor was born in East St. Louis, Illinois, to Robert and Mary (née Pohl) Taylor. After attending St. Henry’s Preparatory Seminary in Belleville, he took his vows for the Oblates of Mary Immaculate in 1934. He continued his studies in Rome, where he attended the Angelicum and the Gregorian.\nOn May 25, 1940, Taylor was ordained to the priesthood in Rome. He earned his Ph.D. at Ottawa University in 1941, with a thesis on the philosophy of John Dewey. Returning to the United States, he taught at the Oblates’ minor seminary in Belleville before serving as superior of Oblate seminaries in Carthage, Missouri (1947-1953) and in Pass Christian, Mississippi (1953-1958).\nIn 1958, Taylor was chosen to lead a mission to revive the Catholic Church in Greenland. He first established a headquarters in the Copenhagen suburb of Herlev and, in 1960, became the first Catholic priest to settle in Greenland since the Reformation.\n\n\n== Bishop of Stockholm ==\nOn July 2, 1962, Taylor was appointed Bishop of Stockholm in Sweden by Pope John XXIII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following September 21 from Archbishop Bruno Heim, with Bishops Jacques Mangers and Fulton J. Sheen serving as co-consecrators, in the Blue Hall of Stockholm City Hall. The event was the first consecration of a Catholic bishop in Sweden since 1531.\nDuring his tenure, the estimated number of Catholics in the Diocese of Stockholm (which covers all of Sweden) rose from 27,000 to 75,000, and the number of priests rose from 64 to 97. He also established a priests’ council, a Catholic education commission, and an ecumenical commission. He served as chairman of the Scandinavian Bishops Conference from 1970 to 1973.\nTaylor attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council between 1962 and 1965. He presented Catholic peace activist Tom Cornell with the commemorative medal given to each bishop who participated in the Council, in acknowledgment of \"the role that the Catholic Peace Fellowship, together with the Catholic Worker, played at the Council – the role of invisible Council Father.\"\n\n\n== Later life ==\nFollowing an operation to remove a cerebral tumor, Taylor resigned as Bishop of Stockholm on June 3, 1976. He retired to a nursing home run by the Bridgettines in Djursholm, where he died a few months later on September 9, at the age of 61.\n\n\n== External links ==\nProfile at Catholic Hierarchy website", "links": ["Alvastra Abbey", "Americans", "Anders Arborelius", "Anti-Catholicism", "Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Germany", "Apostolic prefect", "Apostolic vicariate", "Archbishopric of Bremen", "Archdiocese of Uppsala", "Askeby Abbey", "Belleville, Illinois", "Bishop in the Catholic Church", "Black Friars' Monastery of Stockholm", "Blue Hall", "Bridget of Sweden", "Bridgettines", "Bruno Heim", "Bäckaskog Castle", "Börringe Priory", "Caritas International", "Carthage, Missouri", "Catherine of Vadstena", "Catholic Church", "Catholic Church in Greenland", "Catholic Church in Sweden", "Catholic Peace Fellowship", "Catholic Worker", "Catholic missions", "Christianization of Scandinavia", "Consecrator", "Copenhagen", "Council of Trent", "Dacke War", "Dalby Church", "Dalecarlian rebellions", "Diocese of Eskilstuna", "Diocese of Linköping", "Diocese of Lund", "Diocese of Sigtuna", "Diocese of Skara", "Diocese of Strängnäs", "Diocese of Västerås", "Diocese of Växjö", "Diocese of Åbo", "Dissenter Acts (Sweden)", "Djursholm", "Dragsmark Abbey", "East St. Louis, Illinois", "Elizabeth Hesselblad", "Episcopal Conference of Scandinavia", "Eric IX of Sweden", "First Swedish Crusade", "Fulton J.
