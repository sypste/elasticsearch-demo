As far as information is available, the brigade was in the process of being structured in Calella —also known as Calella de la Costa— a shoreline town in the Maresme north of Barcelona, but the names of the commanding officers in charge of the instruction of the recruits are unknown.In the face of the swift and steady advance of the Francoist armies in the heart of Catalonia, the constitution of this eleventh-hour brigade was next to impossible. It is not known whether it became operational and it thus probably existed only on paper.\n\n\n== See also ==\n77th Division\nCatalonia Offensive\nMixed Brigades\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External
