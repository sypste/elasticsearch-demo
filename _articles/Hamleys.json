The world's oldest toy store, it was founded by William Hamley as \"Noah's Ark\" in High Holborn, London, in 1760. It moved to its current site on Regent Street in London's West End in 1881. This flagship store is set over seven floors, with more than 50,000 lines of toys on sale. It receives around five million visitors each year. The chain has 15 outlets in the United Kingdom and also has more than 90 franchises worldwide.\n\n\n== History ==\nHamleys is the oldest and in 1994 was the largest toy shop in the world. It is named after William Hamley, who founded a toy shop called \"Noah's Ark\" at No. 231 High Holborn, London, in 1760. Ownership of the shop passed through the family, and by the time it was operated by Hamley's grandsons in 1837, the store had become famous, counting royalty and nobility among its customers.A branch at 200 Regent Street was opened in 1881. The original High Holborn store was destroyed by fire in 1901 and subsequently relocated to 86–87 High Holborn.Hamleys suffered a downturn through the 1920s and closed, entering receivership, in 1931. After ensuring that it wouldn't alienate their suppliers, the Lines Bros toy company, Hamleys' largest creditor, purchased the company and reopened the Regent Street store by the end of that year, keeping it largely independent. The High Holborn branch, opened in 1901, would not reopen under the new ownershipIn 1938, Queen Mary, consort of King George V, gave Hamleys a royal warrant. During the Second World War, the Regent Street store was bombed five times. In 1955, Queen Elizabeth II gave the company a second royal warrant as a \"toys and sports merchant\".\nIn 1981, Hamleys would move to 188–196 Regent Street.Hamleys was bought in June 2003 by the Baugur Group, an Icelandic investment company. When Baugur collapsed, its stake in the toy store was taken over by the Icelandic bank Landsbanki. In September 2012 Groupe Ludendo, a toy retailer based in France with shops also located in Belgium, Spain and Switzerland, bought Hamleys for a reported £60 million.In October 2015 it was reported that Groupe Ludendo was negotiating the sale of Hamleys, possibly to a Hong Kong company owned by a relative of the owner of department store House of Fraser. It was subsequently purchased by C.Banner, a large Chinese footwear and fashion wear conglomerate based in Nanjing.In May 2019, Indian retail company, Reliance Retail, part of the Reliance Industries, announced that it has acquired Hamleys for £67.96 million (around ₹620 crore) using international bank receipt.\n\n\n== United Kingdom stores ==\n\n\n=== Regent Street ===\n\nHamleys expanded and moved its flagship store from No. 200 Regent Street to its current site at Nos. 188–196, Regent Street, in 1981, which in 1994 was the largest toy shop in the world.\nHamleys' flagship store has seven floors covering 54,000 square feet (5,000 m2), all devoted to toys, with different categories of toy on each floor.

This changed in 1999 with the launch of hamleys.com. The site offered worldwide shipping and focused on user experience, customer service and the sale of traditional products and collectables. The chief executive of Hamleys told Marketing magazine \"I do not want to become embroiled with the likes of Toys 'R'Us, Toyzone and eToys, which are fighting on price alone and will end up making next to no margin\".In 2006, a glitch on the website allowed customers to claim a 60% discount on any product.Econsultancy critiqued the site for its basic approach in 2013, and felt that it \"doesn't do a lot to represent the brand; in fact, it may even detract from it\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nReliance Retail\nBenjamin Pollock's Toy Shop\nGamleys\nNintendo\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website for India\nOfficial website for United Kingdom", "links": ["10 Downing Street", "122 Leadenhall Street", "20 Fenchurch Street", "30 St Mary Axe", "8 Canada Square", "AJIO", "Abu Dhabi", "Adelphi Theatre", "Adil Zainulbhai", "Admiralty Arch", "Ahmedabad One", "Akash Ambani", "Albert Bridge, London", "Albert Memorial", "Aldwych", "Alexandra Palace", "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club", "All Hallows-by-the-Tower", "Alok Agarwal", "Alok Industries", "Amman", "Anand Jain", "Anant Ambani", "Antara Polanco", "Antea LifeStyle Center", "Apollo Victoria Theatre", "ArcelorMittal Orbit", "Artz Pedregal", "Arundhati Bhattacharya", "Ashish Chauhan", "Asteria Aerospace", "BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir London", "BFI IMAX", "BT Tower", "Baker Street", "Bank of England", "Banqueting House, Whitehall", "Barbican Estate", "Barnes Railway Bridge", "Bath, Somerset", "Battersea Bridge", "Battersea Park", "Battersea Power Station", "Baugur Group", "Benjamin Pollock's Toy Shop", "Bevis Marks Synagogue", "Bhubaneswar", "Big Ben", "Bishopsgate", "Blackfriars Bridge", "Blackfriars station", "Bluewater (shopping centre)", "Bond Street", "Bonifacio Global City", "Borough Market", "Brent Cross Shopping Centre", "British Library", "British Museum", "British pound", "Brixton Academy", "Broadgate Tower", "Buckingham Palace", "Burgess Park", "Burlington Arcade", "Buses in London", "Bushy Park", "Camden Market", "Cannon Street station", "Cape Town, South Africa", "Carnaby Street", "Charing Cross Road", "Charing Cross railway station", "Cheapside", "Chelsea Bridge", "Chennai", "Chiswick Bridge", "Churchill War Rooms", "Citigroup Centre, London", "City Hall, London (Newham)", "City Hall, London (Southwark)", "Clapham Common", "Clapham Junction railway station", "Clarence House", "Cleopatra's Needle, London", "College Green, London", "Cornhill, London", "County Hall, London", "Courtauld Gallery", "Covent Garden", "Craven Cottage", "Criterion Theatre", "Crore", "Crystal Palace National Sports Centre", "Crystal Palace transmitting station", "Cutty Sark", "DEN Networks", "Denmark Street", "Dhirubhai Ambani", "Dhirubhai Ambani International School", "Digital Fibre Infrastructure Trust", "Dipak C.
