On March 24, 2020, Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer purchased The Forum from MSG for $400 million.\nThe Forum has previously been known as the Great Western Forum, and was nicknamed \"the Fabulous Forum\" by long-time Lakers play-by-play announcer Chick Hearn. It is also known informally as the L.A. Forum to distinguish it from other places with the name \"Forum\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1960s and 1970s ===\nOn the site of a former golf course, the \"fabulous\" Forum (as it was colloquially known to locals) was built in 1967 by Jack Kent Cooke (owner of the Lakers and founding owner of the Kings). The Canadian Cooke, who enjoyed ice hockey, was determined to bring the National Hockey League (NHL) to Los Angeles.\n\n\n==== Jack Kent Cooke ownership ====\nIn 1966, the NHL announced that it was adding six new franchises for 1967, and Cooke prepared a bid. The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission, which operated the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, supported a competing bid headed by Los Angeles Rams owner Dan Reeves—who already had a hockey team at the Arena, the Western Hockey League's Los Angeles Blades—and told Cooke that if he won the franchise, he would not be allowed to use the facility. In response, Cooke planned to build a new arena in the Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood. Nearly 30 years later, Cooke told Los Angeles Times sportswriter Steve Springer that he remembered \"one official representing the commission laughing at him\" when Cooke said he would build in Inglewood. Cooke won the franchise, paying $2 million for the Los Angeles club, which he called the Kings. According to Springer, \"Cooke went to Inglewood and built the Forum. Goodbye, Lakers. Goodbye, Kings.\"The round, $16 million building was designed by Los Angeles architect Charles Luckman to evoke the Roman Forum. The arena seats 17,505 for basketball, 16,005 for hockey and up to 18,000 for musical concerts; although it has no luxury suites, it had 2,400 club seats for events. More than 70% of the seats are between the goals, and no seat is more than 170 feet (52 m) from the playing surface.\nDuring the Cooke era, the Forum hosted five NBA Finals in its first six years (1967–73). The Boston Celtics celebrated both the 1968 and 1969 championships in the arena, the latter of which marked the final games Bill Russell ever played. The Lakers won the 1972 NBA Finals at the Forum in Game 5, while the New York Knicks' second and most recent championship was also clinched in a Game 5 at the same venue the following season.\nCream played two shows during the band's farewell tour, on October 18–19, 1968, with Deep Purple the opening act. The band's show of October 19 produced the live tracks on their farewell LP, Goodbye. Deep Purple also recorded their part of the show, which was later released as a live album entitled Inglewood – Live in California.\nCrosby, Stills, Nash & Young recorded shows in June and July 1970, including at the Forum. Some of them ended up on their 1971 live album, 4 Way Street.\nThe Rolling Stones performed at the Forum during their 1969, 1972 and 1975 North American tours. Steppenwolf played there during their At Your Birthday Party tour on July 14, 1969, with Three Dog Night the opening act. Three Dog Night recorded their set, which was later released as a live album entitled Captured Live at the Forum.\nQueen played a total of 12 concerts from the A Day at the Races Tour on March 2, 1977, through the Hot Space Tour on September 15, 1982.\nDavid Bowie played concerts here on April 3 and 4, 1978, and again on April 6, 1978.\nThe Jimi Hendrix Experience performed at the forum for the first time on April 26, 1969. A soundboard recording of this concert has been released on Experience Hendrix's Dagger Records, an official bootleg record label. The Experience later performed there again the following year on April 25, 1970, as part of their final U.S. tour. The concert has been widely circulated thanks to 3 available bootleg audience recordings.\nBetween 1970 and 1977 Led Zeppelin performed 16 times at the Forum, including a run of six sold-out dates in 1977. Part of their live album, How the West Was Won, was recorded at the arena. The band's first 1977 show is the source of the bootleg Listen to This Eddie. Another bootleg from the Forum shows, For Badgeholders Only, contains one of the last live performances by Keith Moon on drums, with his surprise performance there.\nThe Jackson 5 performed twice at the Forum: on June 20, 1970, during their first national tour and on August 26, 1972, during their third national tour. The 1970 show broke attendance records, with 18,675 paid admissions and a gross income of $105,000 (when the Jackson 5 had released two albums and three singles). By 1972, they had released seven albums on Motown, in addition to Michael and Jermaine Jackson's solo albums. Both shows were recorded and released as Live at the Forum.\nOn November 14, 1970, Elvis Presley played afternoon and evening shows, with 18,700 and 18,698 paid admissions. He returned for two more sold-out shows on May 11, 1974, with 18,500 paid admissions each. The Osmonds performed two shows on December 4, 1971, which were recorded and released as The Osmonds Live.\nBarbra Streisand performed on April 15, 1972, during Four for McGovern, a fundraiser for George McGovern's presidential campaign. Although ticket prices ranged from $5.50 to $100 and the event grossed $300,000, after expenses were deducted McGovern's campaign received only $18,000. During her set, Streisand asked the audience to choose between \"Second Hand Rose\" and \"Stoney End\" for her next song; the latter was the overwhelming choice. Her performance was recorded and released as Live Concert at the Forum.Bob Dylan's live album Before the Flood with The Band was compiled from songs performed at the Forum over the course of three shows on February 13 and 14, 1974. The only song on the album not recorded at the Forum was \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\", which was recorded in New York City.\nJethro Tull played five sold-out shows in a seven-day stretch in 1975, here at The Forum. The dates were February 3+4, 8–10.\nKiss had their debut there in 1976 on February 23 for two consecutive nights, three days after getting their footprints outside Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood and played three more consecutive nights shows the following year, 1977, on August 26–28 (the first of these shows sold out), with live tracks from these 1977 shows included on their second live album, Alive II, released in October of that same year.\nOn June 21, 1976, Paul McCartney and Wings began a three-night stand at the Forum during their Wings Over the World tour. The shows were McCartney's first live performances in Los Angeles since he played at the Hollywood Bowl in 1964 and 1965 with the Beatles. Some songs played at the Forum appeared on the Wings Over America live LP released later that year and re-released in 2013.\nThe Eagles performed three shows during their Hotel California tour on October 20–22, 1976. The shows were recorded, with some songs appearing on Eagles Live.\nThe Bee Gees appeared at the Forum during their Children of the World tour on December 20, 1976; the show was recorded and released as Here at Last...

The team was owned by Los Angeles businessman Jerry Buss.\nThe Forum hosted several boxing fights, most notably the second Muhammad Ali vs. Ken Norton on September 10, 1973. Several events featured Latin American fighters like José Nápoles, Chucho Castillo, Rubén Olivares, Carlos Zárate Serna and Alfonso Zamora.In 1979, Cooke sold the Forum, the Lakers and the Kings to Buss for a then-record $67.5 million.\n\n\n=== 1980s ===\nThe Lakers were successful during the 1980s, winning five NBA championships and making the NBA Finals every year except 1981 and 1986. They won the 1982, 1987 and 1988 championships at the Forum. The Philadelphia 76ers and Detroit Pistons were the only visiting teams to win a championship at the Forum during this period; both teams clinched the title in a Game 4 sweep in 1983 and 1989 respectively.\nThe Lakers' owner, Jerry Buss, also purchased the Los Angeles Strings expansion franchise of the second incarnation of TeamTennis (the original team and league having folded in 1978) and appointed his 19-year-old daughter Jeanie Buss as the tennis team's general manager, with all home matches played at the Forum.\nIn 1981, Diana Ross filmed the concert portion of her Diana television special at the Forum, entering the arena through the audience and singing her 1980 Billboard top-five hit \"I'm Coming Out\". Guests included Quincy Jones (who conducted a performance of \"Home\" from The Wiz) and Michael Jackson, who joined Ross onstage for a performance of her 1980 number-one song \"Upside Down\". The special began with Ross in a photo session atop the Forum in a silver lamé bodysuit with large, silver-lamé wings.\nOn December 10, 1981, Devo performed at the Forum during their New Traditionalists tour.In April 1982, the Forum was the site of the \"Miracle on Manchester\", in which the Kings overcame a 5–0 deficit in a first-round Stanley Cup playoff game against the Edmonton Oilers to win 6–5 in overtime. With additional upset wins in Games 1 and 5 of the five-game series, the Kings eliminated the heavily favored Oilers to reach the second round.\nIn September 1982, on their Hot Space Tour, Queen played their final U.S. concert ever at the Forum.\nFleetwood Mac played two shows during its Mirage tour on October 21–22, 1982, with Dave Mason opening.

They were recorded for the band's tour video, which was televised in 1983.Genesis played five consecutive sold out concerts at the Forum from October 13–17, 1986, during the first leg of their Invisible Touch Tour.\nMexican boxer Julio César Chávez fought at the venue against Ruben Castillo in 1995, Vernon Buchanan in 1988 and Roger Mayweather in 1989.\nRock bands AC/DC and Cinderella performed on November 13, 1988.\nIron Maiden on July 12, 1988\n\n\n==== Summer Olympics ====\nIn 1984, the Forum hosted the basketball tournaments and the men's handball finals of the 1984 Summer Olympics. The arena hosted Amnesty International's June 6, 1986 A Conspiracy of Hope benefit concert, headlined by U2 and Sting and featuring Bryan Adams, Jackson Browne, Peter Gabriel, Lou Reed, Joan Baez and the Neville Brothers.\nIn 1989, Neil Diamond set the all-time attendance record at the Forum by surpassing his already leading record of seven sold-out shows (in 1983) with eight sold-out shows. For doing so, Diamond was presented with a gold plaque, stating his accomplishment(s).\n\n\n=== Great Western era ===\n\nOn December 5, 1988, it was announced that Jerry Buss sold the arena's naming rights to Great Western Savings & Loan, coinciding with the arrival in Los Angeles of hockey star Wayne Gretzky. The building exterior was repainted blue, replacing its original \"California sunset red.\" It was renamed the Great Western Forum; the name was retained for several years, even after Great Western was acquired by Washington Mutual (now Chase) and ceased to exist. Although naming-rights agreements are now commonplace in major American sports, they were rare at the time of Buss's deal with Great Western. There was some initial criticism of the name change, and local residents continued to call the arena \"the Forum.\" Adverse reaction was eventually muted; Great Western Forum sounded like a natural name because of the arena's location in the western United States.\n\n\n=== 1990s ===\nBefore the 1991–92 NBA and NHL seasons, a new scoreboard was installed, replacing the one in use since the building opened in 1967. The original scoreboard, designed by All American Scoreboards in Pardeeville, Wisconsin, had a two-line message board on each side (the third electronic message board in the NHL, and the second in the NBA). The new scoreboard, designed by Daktronics, kept the two-line message boards and added a Sony Jumbotron scoreboard on each side.\nGuns N' Roses with Skid Row played four sold-out shows during the Use Your Illusion Tour on July 29, July 30, August 2, and August 3, 1991.\nThe Forum hosted the 1991 NBA Finals and was the site of the Chicago Bulls' first NBA championship victory. It also hosted Games 3 and 4 of the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals between the Kings and Montreal Canadiens, the only time the Stanley Cup Finals was held at the arena. Coincidentally, Montreal's home rink at the time was also called the Forum.\nMexican boxer Juan Manuel Márquez won 12 fights at the Forum in the 1990s, whereas Marco Antonio Barrera claimed ten consecutive wins at the venue.\nOn June 28, 1997, a non televised special edition of WCW Nitro was held at the Forum.\nBy the middle of the decade the Great Western Forum was considered too small; it lacked luxury boxes and had insufficient retail and commercial space. Los Angeles officials, seeking to redevelop the city center, began planning a new downtown sports arena and entertainment complex and hoped to attract the Lakers and Kings from Inglewood.\nThe Kings' owners, who were real-estate developers, agreed to develop the complex; Buss agreed to move the Lakers into the new arena as co-tenants with the Kings and a third tenant, the NBA's Clippers, who would move there from the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. The new Staples Center (now Crypto.com Arena) opened on October 17, 1999; as part of the deal, Buss sold the Great Western Forum to the L. A. Arena Company (which was controlled by the Kings' owners).\n\n\n=== Final games ===\nOn April 18, 1999, the Kings played their final regular-season NHL game at the Forum, a 3–2 loss to the St. Louis Blues, on the day that former King and Blue Wayne Gretzky played his final NHL game as a member of the New York Rangers; their last game altogether at the Fabulous Forum was an 8–1 preseason win over the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim on September 20 of that year. Staples Center was still under construction, so the Kings played their remaining preseason home games at the San Diego Sports Arena and the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. The Lakers' 118–107 playoff loss to the eventual NBA champion San Antonio Spurs on May 23, 1999, was their last regular or postseason game played at the Forum; they played two preseason games there the following year before they moved to Staples Center.\n\n\n=== 2000s ===\nThe Los Angeles Sparks played their 2000 season at the arena before following the Lakers and Clippers to Staples Center. The Great Western Forum hosted live events, offices and training facilities for the 2000–2001 Women of Wrestling season.\nFaithful Central Bible Church, with a congregation of over 12,000, purchased the Great Western Forum at the end of 2000 and began holding church services there on Sunday mornings. Unlike Houston's Lakewood Church, which converted the former Summit into their church, Faithful Central representatives said that they never intended to convert the arena for religious purposes; in 2009, the church discontinued the regular use of the Forum for services.During the Faithful Central ownership, the arena was available for concerts, sporting events and other activities requiring a large venue. It was owned by the church's for-profit entity, Forum Enterprises, which accommodated secular and pop-music artists. The church influenced the approval of performers, however; in 2005 and 2009 the Forum refused to allow performances by heavy metal band Lamb of God, whose former name was Burn the Priest.On February 14, 2003, Phish began their first post-hiatus tour at the Forum. A fan jumped onstage during \"AC/DC Bag\", and they performed a cover of Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show's \"The Cover of Rolling Stone\" after appearing on the magazine's cover.In 2003, Great Western's naming-rights contract on the building expired (despite being bought by Washington Mutual in 1997, their name had been retained in the interim), and Forum Enterprises changed the venue's name back to \"the Forum\". The Great Western corporate logo and the words \"Great Western\" remained on portions of the exterior, including the roof (with a logo visible to planes landing at LAX), and were slowly removed over time. The roof, which was the last part of the building to contain the \"GW\" logo and \"Great Western Forum\" name, would not be repainted until the MSG remodeling, when it was overlaid with the new \"Forum Presented by Chase\" logo.\nIn 2004 Madonna premiered the Re-Invention World Tour at the Forum, which was filmed for the documentary I'm Going To Tell You A Secret.\nThe Forum was made available for film use, including interior shots for the 2002 film Like Mike. The Foo Fighters used the building as a setting for the music video for \"All My Life\" in 2003, featuring the building's exterior in its opening and closing shots. In 2008, a scene for the 2009 film Hannah Montana: The Movie and the video for Weezer's \"Troublemaker\" (from their 2008 Red Album) were filmed outside the Forum.\nIron Maiden appeared during their Somewhere Back in Time World Tour on February 19, 2008, with Lauren Harris their opening act. Their live version of \"The Number of the Beast\" was included on the documentary Iron Maiden: Flight 666.\nIn May and June 2009, Michael Jackson rehearsed at the Forum for his This Is It concert series in London. After Jackson died on June 25, 2009, footage of these rehearsals and those at Staples Center became part of Michael Jackson's This Is It.\nOn October 9, 2009, the Lakers returned to the Forum for a preseason game against the Golden State Warriors to celebrate the team's 50th season in Los Angeles; the Lakers lost, 110–91.\n\n\n=== 2010s: MSG era ===\nIn 2011, Prince began a 21-show run at the Forum. After acquiring the arena in June 2012, the Madison Square Garden Company announced plans for a $50 million renovation. The City of Inglewood made an $18 million commercial-rehabilitation loan, contingent on MSG's $50 million investment. The arena was renamed \"The Forum, presented by Chase\" to reflect its sponsor, Chase Bank (which had incidentally purchased Great Western's legal successor, Washington Mutual, a few years earlier), and its exterior returned to the original red. New features also included new lighting, new seating, LED video systems and HD screen and new retail.\n\n\n==== Events after reopening ====\nThe Forum reopened with six concerts by the Eagles during their History of the Eagles – Live in Concert tour on January 15, 17, 18, 22, 24 and 25, 2014. On March 15–16, the Forum hosted the men's freestyle wrestling World Cup.On May 17, 2014, the Forum hosted its first boxing card since 2001. Mexican Juan Manuel Márquez defeated Mike Alvarado for the WBO international welterweight championship, for the right to challenge world champion Manny Pacquiao. The event was broadcast by HBO's Boxing After Dark, the first time since its 1996 premiere that the series presented a card from the Forum. On May 16, 2015, Gennady Golovkin defeated Willie Monroe Jr. during a live broadcast on HBO Boxing. Golovkin returned the following year on April 23, 2016, to battle Dominic Wade, which resulted in a second-round KO.On August 24, 2014, the arena hosted the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards, the first major awards show at the Forum. The arena was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 24, 2014.The Foo Fighters performed on January 10, 2015, to celebrate singer Dave Grohl's 46th birthday.

The acquisition was needed in order to enable the construction of the Clippers' new Intuit Dome in Inglewood; the Clippers accused MSG of using litigation to block construction of the new arena, which they feared would cannibalize the Forum's live events business.The venue was closed from March 2020 due to COVID-19. The Forum reopened on July 31, 2021, hosting Bellator 263. A concert by the Foo Fighters on July 17, 2021, was originally scheduled to be its first event, but it was postponed due to COVID-19 cases within the band's staff.In February 2022, it was announced that All Elite Wrestling (AEW) would host a live broadcast of Dynamite from the Forum on June 1, 2022, marking its first professional wrestling event since 2015.On April 4, 2022, Kia Motors acquired the naming rights to the facility, renaming it Kia Forum.\n\n\n=== 2028 Summer Olympics ===\nThe Forum is slated to host the Gymnastics events for the 2028 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of entertainment events at Kia Forum\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to The Forum (Inglewood, California) at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial website", "links": ["1949 BAA Finals", "1950 NBA Finals", "1952 NBA Finals", "1953 NBA Finals", "1954 NBA Finals", "1967 NHL Expansion Draft", "1967 NHL expansion", "1967–68 NHL season", "1968 NBA Finals", "1969 NBA Finals", "1972 NBA All-Star Game", "1972 NBA Finals", "1973 NBA Finals", "1974 North American Soccer League season", "1975 North American Soccer League season", "1976 North American Soccer League season", "1977 North American Soccer League season", "1978 North American Soccer League season", "1979 North American Soccer League season", "1979–80 NASL Indoor season", "1980 NBA Finals", "1980 North American Soccer League season", "1980–81 NASL Indoor season", "1981 NBA Playoffs", "1981 North American Soccer League season", "1982 NBA Finals", "1983 NBA All-Star Game", "1983 NBA Finals", "1984 Summer Olympics", "1985 NBA Finals", "1986 NBA Playoffs", "1987 NBA Finals", "1988 Kids' Choice Awards", "1988 NBA Finals", "1989 Kids' Choice Awards", "1989 NBA Finals", "1990 Kids' Choice Awards", "1991 Kids' Choice Awards", "1991 NBA Finals", "1991 outdoor NHL game in Las Vegas", "1992 Kids' Choice Awards", "1993 Stanley Cup Finals", "1994 Kids' Choice Awards", "1995 Kids' Choice Awards", "1996 Kids' Choice Awards", "1997 Kids' Choice Awards", "1997 Los Angeles Sparks season", "1998 Kids' Choice Awards", "1998 Los Angeles Sparks season", "1999 Kids' Choice Awards", "1999 Los Angeles Sparks season", "2000 Kids' Choice Awards", "2000 Los Angeles Sparks season", "2000 NBA Finals", "2001 Kids' Choice Awards", "2001 Los Angeles Sparks season", "2001 NBA Finals", "2001 WNBA Championship", "2002 Kids' Choice Awards", "2002 Los Angeles Sparks season", "2002 NBA Finals", "2002 WNBA Finals", "2003 Kids' Choice Awards", "2003 Los Angeles Sparks season", "2003 WNBA Finals", "2004 Kids' Choice Awards", "2004 Los Angeles Sparks season", "2005 Kids' Choice Awards", "2005 Los Angeles Sparks season", "2006 Kids' Choice Awards", "2006 Los Angeles Sparks season", "2006 WNBA Playoffs", "2007 Kids' Choice Awards", "2007 Los Angeles Sparks season", "2008 Kids' Choice Awards", "2008 Los Angeles Sparks season", "2008 WNBA Playoffs", "2009 Kids' Choice Awards", "2009 Los Angeles Sparks season", "2009 NBA Finals", "2009 WNBA Playoffs", "2010 Kids' Choice Awards", "2010 Los Angeles Sparks season", "2010 NBA Finals", "2010 WNBA Playoffs", "2011 Kids' Choice Awards", "2011 Los Angeles Sparks season", "2011 NHL Premiere", "2012 Kids' Choice Awards", "2012 Los Angeles Sparks season", "2012 WNBA Playoffs", "2013 Kids' Choice Awards", "2013 Los Angeles Sparks season", "2013 WNBA Playoffs", "2014 FILA Wrestling World Cup -
