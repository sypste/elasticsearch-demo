The pub is a Grade II listed building, and was historically used as a coffee warehouse.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Captain Kidd pub is situated at 108 Wapping High Street, next door to the Marine Police Force headquarters. The building originates in the 19th century as a three-storey brick house, and was remodelled in the Edwardian era. To the rear of the building, there is a former workshop that goes out to a wharf. The building, along with 110 Wapping High Street, are now Grade II listed.In the 1980s, the building became a pub, having previously been a coffee warehouse. It was named after the seventeenth century pirate William Kidd, who was executed at the nearby Execution Dock in 1701. The pub has a nautical theme and retells the story of Captain Kidd and his execution; the layout of the pub is designed to be similar to a ship's hulk. It is a Sam Smith's pub, and is situated on Wapping High Street. The entrance has a large archway, and the pub has three floors, and has a terrace overlooking the River Thames.\n\n\n== References ==", "links": ["Admiral Duncan (pub)", "Admiralty, Trafalgar Square",
