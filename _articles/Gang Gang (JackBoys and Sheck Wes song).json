The song's instrumental was originally used in American rapper Mar90s' December 2019 track, “Blue Hunnits” (featuring Slim Jxmmi), which was released two days prior.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nThe song contains an interpolation of \"Win\" by Jay Rock. Kevin Cortez of HipHopDX, in a review of JackBoys, wrote that Sheck Wes \"glides through 'Gang Gang' with a bag full of adlibs and charisma.\" Cortez described the song's hook (sung by Don Toliver with Sheck Wes and Travis Scott as backup vocals) as reminiscent of ASAP Rocky's \"Babushka Boi\", and the background humming as similar to that of Kid Cudi's.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe official music video was released along with a short film by JackBoys on December 27, 2019. Co-directed by Scott (under his alias Cactus Jack) and White Trash Tyler, the music video follows the events of the short film. It depicts Travis Scott as a bandit alongside his crew, consisting of Sheck Wes, Don Toliver and Chase B, who ride around in an abandoned parking lot. Scott is seen riding in a Tesla Cyberquad and Tesla Cybertruck, and playing with The Boring Company's Not-A-Flamethrower.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== References ==",
