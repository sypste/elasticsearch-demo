    "content": "We Are Dating Now is a 2002 South Korean television series starring Chae Rim and So Ji-sub. It aired on SBS from January 16 to March 7, 2002 on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:55 for 16 episodes.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n\n=== Youth ===\nNeighbours Ho-jung and Kyo-in as youths have developed a quarrelsome relationship. As a youth Ho-jung made several blind dates, namely Jae-young, Hyun-min, Jin-sung and Jeong Hoon. Cha-hee had also dated Kyo-in during their youth, who rejected her. The girls and their family missed Kyo-in and Ho-jae when they entered the army together.\nTheir friends, Soo-ji and Ho-jae, met stiff opposition from their parents since their youth when they developed relations. When Ho-jae was about to be enrolled into the army, Soo-ji ran away from home for a day, even forgetting to put on her shoes. This prompted Ho-jae to remove his shoes and lend it to Soo-ji, suffering the cold winter road until they reach a shoe retail shop where he bought a new pair of black shoes for Soo-ji. At night, when they slept in a hotel, Soo-ji promised that she would send him 1000 letters, daily, during his entire term in the army, by presenting a red card with the number \"1000\" drawn on a red heart. This act affectionately touched Ho-jae and he gave her a hug.\n\n\n=== Adult life ===\nAfter serving the army, Kyo-in was employed into a company together with his friend Gun-woo, whom he first met when they helped a fellow employee-to-be during an interview who had taken ill, and they became friends from there. Ho-jung herself has already become an established photographer, and had graduated from university.\nHowever, things turned sour when Ho-jung turned her sights to Gun-woo, and once Gun-woo and Kyo-in fought at their office for Ho-jung.\nMeanwhile, Ho-jae was inspired to become a model upon meeting Cha-hee, who had already a well-established modelling career. He posed for a magazine as a replacement model, and later asked for money from his parents to study in a modelling institute. At this time, Ho-jae proposed to Soo-ji, but they met with stiff opposition from their parents. The couple then approached a statue of Jesus Christ, pleading him to permit their relation.\nThe couple bought a small, cheap flat unit on the top floor of a flat, shortly after Soo-ji's parents forsook her. A few months later, Ho-jae bought a car, which made Soo-ji extremely happy.\nHo-jae's character eventually turned for the worse when he began frequenting nightclubs with his friends, frequently returning home drunk. An angry Soo-ji isolated him, but under Cha-hee's direction, she arranged a private dinner at home, wearing an evening gown as an attempt to entice Ho-jae into her lure. When Ho-jae returned home, he was rather shocked upon seeing Soo-ji's unusual behaviour. However, his attitude briefly changed for the better when he realised that Soo-ji wanted to spend a romantic night with him, saying, \"Why didn't you say earlier? I am an expert in this field!\".\nHearing that, Soo-ji's mood changed for the worse, and asked Ho-jae to make his point clear. Ho-jae's attempt made Soo-ji even angrier, and she pushed him away when he tried to approach her.\nHo-jung finally gave up on Seon-woo, and her mother returned the wedding ring given to Ho-jung to him. The two later met, and Seon-woo gave her an ice-cream treat, saying that ice-cream is good for people who are depressed. That night, he brought her to a karaoke, and sang a song. Ho-jung looked on sympathetically.\n\n\n=== Sweet endings ===\nFinally, Ho-jae and Soo-ji got married in a mini-celebration with the approval of their parents. Soo-ji and Ho-jae bumped into each other when they did the traditional Korean bow, which created a comical atmosphere. The friends were a little surprised when Kyo-in showed up late.\nOne night, some time later, while returning home from work, Kyo-in and Ho-jung happened to pass the same shop window and both thought of their past memories. Both of them later happened to be on the same subway platform, Kyo-in tried to give chase when Ho-jung got on the train but the doors closed as he rushed towards it.\nKyo-in got on the next train and sat on the stairs that he visited frequently with Ho-jung. As he was about to leave, Ho-jung called out to him. The couple sat next to each other on the stairs, and asked about Seon-woo. Ho-jung admitted that she occasionally contacts Seon-woo.\nHo-jung notices a ring on Kyo-in's little finger and comments on it. Kyo-in removed the ring from his hand, and said that he had bought it a long time ago for his love. Then he says that he'll give it to the woman that he'll love in the future. Ho-jung protests that no woman will accept it with that kind of history. Kyo-in puts the ring on her palm and tells her that she doesn't have to wear but to please keep it for him. Ho-jung stares at it, realizing that the woman he had bought the ring for many years ago was her. She slowly puts it on her finger and smiles at him. The couple gently  nudge their heads together and smile happily.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nChae Rim as Yoon Ho-jungThe older sister of Ho-jae, she is interested in photography and later becomes a photographer after winning a contest.
