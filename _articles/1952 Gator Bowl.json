It was the seventh annual playing of the Gator Bowl.  The game pitted the Miami Hurricanes against the Clemson Tigers\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Hurricanes, after losing their first game of the season to Tulane, won the next four games to lean into the AP rankings at #19 before facing #14 Kentucky. However, a 32–0 loss in Kentucky dropped them out of the rankings, though they did win three of their final four games to finish with seven regular season victories, a slight drop from the nine the previous season. This was their third bowl game in six years and first bowl game appearance outside of the Orange Bowl.\nClemson won the first three games of the season to rise to #16 in the polls before a matchup with #20 Pacific dropped them out, with a loss to South Carolina twelve days later making them 3–2. The Tigers would rebound to win their final four regular season games to finish 5th in the Southern Conference while finishing their fourth consecutive season .500 or better. This was their third bowl game in four seasons and second Gator bowl in three years.\n\n\n== Game summary ==\nHarry Mellios scored two touchdowns for Miami (the first from 11 yards out and the second from 2 yards out) in the first half, with the scores proving to be the difference in a game dominated by stagnation. Miami won the game despite having less first downs (5 to Clemson's 14), less rushing yards (119 to the Tigers' 145), less passing yards (55 to Clemson's 88), and more penalties and punts (four for 30 yards and 9 punts for 44.5 yards average). However, it was the four interceptions thrown by Clemson quarterback Billy Hair (all caught by MVP Jim Dooley, who played both offense and defense) that proved crucial to the victory.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nMiami was not invited to another bowl game until 1961 (though they did finish 6th ranked in the AP Poll in 1956). Their next Gator Bowl appearance would not be until 2000. Clemson left the Southern Conference after the game, joining the Atlantic Coast Conference in 1953. They were not invited to a bowl game again until 1957, with the next Gator Bowl appearance not being until 1977.\n\n\n== References ==", "links": ["1935 Orange Bowl", "1940 Cotton Bowl Classic", "1946 Gator Bowl", "1946 Orange Bowl", "1947 Gator Bowl", "1948 Gator Bowl", "1949 Gator Bowl", "1950 Gator Bowl", "1951 Clemson Tigers football team", "1951 Gator Bowl", "1951 Miami Hurricanes football team", "1951 Orange Bowl", "1951 Refrigerator Bowl", "1951 college football season", "1951–52 NCAA football bowl games", "1952 Cotton Bowl Classic", "1952 Orange Bowl", "1952 Pineapple Bowl", "1952 Rose Bowl", "1952 Salad Bowl", "1952 Sugar Bowl", "1952 Sun Bowl", "1952 Tangerine Bowl", "1953 Gator Bowl", "1954 Gator Bowl (December)", "1954 Gator Bowl (January)", "1955 Gator Bowl", "1956 Gator Bowl", "1957 Gator Bowl", "1957 Orange Bowl", "1958 Gator Bowl", "1959 Bluebonnet Bowl", "1959 Sugar Bowl", "1960 Gator Bowl (December)", "1960 Gator Bowl (January)", "1961 Gator Bowl", "1961 Liberty Bowl", "1962 Gator Bowl", "1962 Gotham Bowl", "1963 Gator Bowl", "1965 Gator Bowl (December)", "1965 Gator Bowl (January)", "1966 Gator Bowl", "1966 Liberty Bowl", "1967 Bluebonnet Bowl", "1967 Gator Bowl", "1968 Gator Bowl", "1969 Gator Bowl", "1971 Gator Bowl (December)", "1971 Gator Bowl (January)", "1972 Gator Bowl", "1973 Gator Bowl", "1974 Gator Bowl", "1975 Gator Bowl", "1976 Gator Bowl", "1977 Gator Bowl", "1978 Gator Bowl", "1979 Gator Bowl", "1979 Peach Bowl", "1980 Gator Bowl", "1981 Gator Bowl", "1981 Peach Bowl (January)", "1982 Gator Bowl", "1982 Orange Bowl", "1983 Gator Bowl", "1984 Gator Bowl", "1984 Orange Bowl", "1985 Fiesta Bowl", "1985 Gator Bowl", "1985 Independence Bowl", "1986 Gator Bowl", "1986 Sugar Bowl", "1987 Fiesta Bowl", "1987 Gator Bowl", "1988 Florida Citrus Bowl", "1988 Orange Bowl", "1989 Florida Citrus Bowl", "1989 Gator Bowl (December)", "1989 Gator Bowl (January)", "1989 Orange Bowl", "1990 Sugar Bowl", "1991 Cotton Bowl Classic", "1991 Gator Bowl (December)", "1991 Gator Bowl (January)", "1991 Hall of Fame Bowl", "1992 Florida Citrus Bowl", "1992 Gator Bowl", "1992 Orange Bowl", "1993 Gator Bowl", "1993 Peach Bowl (December)", "1993 Sugar Bowl", "1994 Fiesta Bowl", "1994 Gator Bowl", "1995 Orange Bowl", "1996 Carquest Bowl", "1996 Gator Bowl", "1996 Peach Bowl", "1997 Gator Bowl", "1998 Gator Bowl", "1998 MicronPC Bowl", "1998 Peach Bowl (January)", "1999 Gator Bowl", "1999 Peach Bowl", "2000 Gator Bowl", "2001 Gator Bowl", "2001 Humanitarian Bowl", "2001 Sugar Bowl", "2002 Gator Bowl", "2002 Rose Bowl", "2002 Tangerine Bowl", "2003 Fiesta Bowl", "2003 Gator Bowl", "2004 Gator Bowl", "2004 Orange Bowl", "2004 Peach Bowl (December)", "2004 Peach Bowl (January)", "2005 Champs Sports Bowl", "2005 Gator Bowl", "2005 Peach Bowl", "2006 Gator Bowl", "2006 MPC Computers Bowl", "2006 Music City Bowl", "2007 Chick-fil-A Bowl", "2007 Gator Bowl", "2008 Emerald Bowl", "2008 Gator Bowl", "2009 Champs Sports Bowl", "2009 Gator Bowl", "2009 Music City Bowl", "2010 Gator Bowl", "2010 Meineke Car Care Bowl", "2010 Sun Bowl", "2011 Gator Bowl", "2012 Chick-fil-A Bowl", "2012 Gator Bowl", "2012 Orange Bowl", "2013 Gator Bowl", "2013 Russell Athletic Bowl", "2014 Gator Bowl", "2014 Independence Bowl", "2014 Orange Bowl (January)", "2014 Russell Athletic Bowl", "2015 Orange Bowl", "2015 Sun Bowl", "2015 TaxSlayer Bowl", "2016 College Football Playoff National Championship", "2016 Fiesta Bowl (December)", "2016 Russell Athletic Bowl", "2016 TaxSlayer Bowl (December)", "2016 TaxSlayer Bowl (January)", "2017 College Football Playoff National Championship", "2017 Orange Bowl", "2017 TaxSlayer Bowl", "2018 Cotton Bowl Classic", "2018 Gator Bowl", "2018 Pinstripe Bowl", "2018 Sugar Bowl", "2019 College Football Playoff National Championship", "2019 Fiesta Bowl (December)", "2019 Independence Bowl", "2020 Cheez-It Bowl", "2020 College Football Playoff National Championship", "2020 Gator Bowl", "2021 Cheez-It Bowl", "2021 Gator Bowl (December)", "2021 Gator Bowl (January)", "2021 Sugar Bowl", "AP Poll", "Andy Gustafson", "Associated Press", "Atlantic Coast Conference", "Ben Hill Griffin Stadium", "Big Ten Conference", "Bloomington, Illinois", "Bowl game", "College Football Playoff", "College football", "Frank Howard (American football coach)", "Gator Bowl", "Gator Bowl (game)", "Gator Bowl Stadium", "Jacksonville, Florida", "Jim Dooley", "List of Clemson Tigers bowl games", "List of Gator Bowl broadcasters", "List of Miami Hurricanes bowl games", "NCAA Division I FBS independent schools", "Southeastern Conference", "Southern Conference", "TIAA Bank Field", "TaxSlayer Bowl", "The Pantagraph"]}
