In the 1950s, the architecture firm Smith and Williams designed two buildings on the site. They built a children's chapel (1954) and a Sunday-school building (1956). Garrett Eckbo designed the grounds. The children's chapel won an AIA Award of Merit in 1954. The Sequoyah School became a part-time tenant of the church in 1958. The original church was demolished in 1974 when Caltrans was planning to expand the 710 Freeway through the site, but the project remains unrealized due to community opposition. The Smith and Williams buildings remains to this day.\nIn 2013, the campus was expanded by Los Angeles architecture firm, Fung + Blatt Architects. Weaving into the existing mid-century campus fabric, Sequoyah’s expansion echoes the spirit of the original architecture, while providing a sustainable, contemporary interpretation for a new generation. The expansion was published in Architectural Record and also won an honor award for design and a sustainability award by the AIA Pasadena & Foothills chapter The high school campus is located on the grounds of the Neighborhood Church in Pasadena, adjacent to the historic Gamble House and within walking distance of playing fields in the Arroyo  and the Rose Bowl Aquatic Center. It is only a few miles away from the K-8 campus.\n\n\n== Financial Aid ==\nSequoyah School maintains a financial assistance program that provides tuition support to approximately 30-40% of its student population, including its Yvonne Pinto Fund, dedicated to the students of employees of the school. The School is well known for its ethnic, racial, gender, cultural, and economic diversity.\n\n\n== Governance ==\nThe school is governed by a Board of Trustees.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website", "links": ["AGBU Manoogian-Demirdjian School", "AGBU Vatche and Tamar Manoukian High School", "Alverno Heights Academy", "Ambassador Auditorium", "Ambassador College", "Annandale, Pasadena, California", "Armenian Mesrobian School", "Armory Center for the Arts", "Art Center College of Design", "Banbury Oaks, Pasadena, California", "Bellarmine-Jefferson High School", "Bellefontaine/Governor Markham, Pasadena, California", "Berkeley Hall School", "Bethel Christian School (California)", "Bishop Alemany High School", "Bishop Amat Memorial High School", "Bishop Conaty-Our Lady of Loretto High School", "Bishop Montgomery High School", "Blair International Baccalaureate School", "Brentwood School (Los Angeles)", "Brigden Ranch, Pasadena, California", "Brookside Golf Course", "Brookside Park/Arroyo Terrace, Pasadena, California", "Buckley School (California)", "Bungalow Heaven, Pasadena, California", "California", "California Art Club", "California Department of Transportation", "California Institute of Technology", "California Village, Pasadena, California", "Campbell Hall School", "Cantwell-Sacred Heart of Mary High School", "Casa Grande, Pasadena, California", "Catalina Villas, Pasadena, California", "Cathedral High School (Los Angeles)", "Chadwick School", "Chaminade College Preparatory School (California)", "Chandler School", "Chapman, Pasadena, California", "Chatsworth Hills Academy", "City of Knowledge Islamic School", "Co-educational", "Community service", "Corvallis High School (California)", "Crespi Carmelite High School", "Crossroads School (Santa Monica, California)", "Daisy-Villa, Pasadena, California", "Damien High School", "Day school", "De Toledo High School", "Desert Christian Schools (California)", "Don Bosco Technical Institute", "East Washington Village, Pasadena, California", "Eaton Canyon", "Ferrahian Armenian School", "Flintridge Preparatory School", "Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy", "Fuller Theological Seminary", "Garfield Heights, Pasadena, California", "Geographic coordinate system", "Good Shepherd Lutheran School", "Hahamog-na", "Harvard-Westlake School", "Hastings Ranch, Pasadena, California", "Highland College", "Highland Hall Waldorf School", "History of Pasadena, California", "Holy Family High School (Glendale, California)", "Huntington Hospital", "ISNI (identifier)", "Immaculate Heart High School (Los Angeles)", "Independent School", "Indiana Colony", "International Bilingual School", "International School of Los Angeles", "Jefferson Park, Pasadena, California", "Jewish Educational Trade School", "John Muir High School", "John Thomas Dye School", "Junípero Serra High School (Gardena, California)", "Kaiser Permanente Bernard J.
