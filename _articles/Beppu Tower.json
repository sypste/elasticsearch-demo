It has an observation deck at a height of 55 metres (180 ft).\n\n\n== History ==\nBeppu Tower was built in two years, from 1956 to 1957 and was originally planned to open the Beppu Tourism Exhibition, held from March 20 through May 20, 1957. Construction was slightly delayed, however, and the tower was not completed until May 10, ten days before the exhibition ended. Its original name was Sightseeing Center TV Tower (観光センターテレビ塔, Kankō-sentā-terebitō) until 1961 when it was officially changed to Beppu Tower. \nThe tower first displayed advertising for National. Currently, it displays eight neon Asahi signs—four in English, four in Japanese.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nGodzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of towers\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Beppu Tower at Wikimedia Commons",
