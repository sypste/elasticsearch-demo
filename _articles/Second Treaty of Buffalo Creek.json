This established the original boundaries of the Oneida Reservation of Wisconsin.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Seneca nation, represented by certain chiefs including Red Jacket, Cornplanter, Handsome Lake, and Governor Blacksnake, agreed to the following. Based on the terms of the accord, the US was to sell the five remaining Seneca reservations (Buffalo Creek Reservation, Tonawanda Reservation, Oil Springs Reservation, Cattaraugus Reservation, and Allegany Reservation) and provide for the Seneca to relocate to a tract of land in present-day Kansas (then territory), west of Missouri.  A section of the treaty acknowledged that the Ogden Land Company (the land company founded by former Holland Land Company attorney David A. Ogden, who by this time was deceased) would buy the five reservations then occupied by the Seneca Nation.  The understanding was that the Ogden Land Company would sell the land to settlers for development.\nThe treaty was met with some controversy and resistance by Quakers residing in New York, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. These groups filed charges of fraud against the Ogden Company. Seneca young chief Maris Bryant Pierce served as a lawyer representing four of the territories. Some Seneca groups also claimed that most Iroquois did not support the treaty and that only a minority actually signed it. Some of these grievances helped lead to another meeting between these two parties and the creation of the further treaties.  \nUltimately, the Ogden Land Company abandoned its attempts to purchase the Allegany, Cattaraugus and Oil Spring reservations, leading to the Third Treaty of Buffalo Creek in 1842.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTreaty of Fort Stanwix (1784)\nTreaty of Canandaigua\nTreaty of Big Tree\nFirst Treaty of Buffalo Creek (1788)\nThird Treaty of Buffalo Creek (1842)\nFourth Treaty of Buffalo Creek (1857)\nList of treaties\nFellows v.
