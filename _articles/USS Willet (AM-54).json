A. J. Chantry, CC; and commissioned on 29 January 1920.\n\n\n== World War I-related operations ==\nAfter brief service with the Atlantic Fleet Train Willet was decommissioned on 29 May 1920 and simultaneously transferred, on loan, to the United States Shipping Board.\n\n\n== World War II operations ==\nShe operated with the civilian firm of Merritt, Chapman, and Scott through World War II. (During the 1920s and 1930s, she was based at the Merritt, Chapman, and Scott salvage depot in New York City before being shifted to Key West, Florida, from which point she operated during World War II.)\n\n\n== Reclassified as salvage vessel ==\nClassified as a salvage vessel on 13 September 1941 and simultaneously redesignated ARS-12. Willet operated in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico through the end of hostilities. She assisted stranded or grounded vessels, fought fires on burning ships, and escorted coastwise convoy runs.\n\n\n== Post-war activity ==\nDeclared surplus to naval needs on 1 December 1947, Willet was struck from the Navy list on 5 December 1947. Although listed as \"disposed of\" as of 6 July 1948 subsequent records indicate that the ship lay berthed at the Navy Net Depot at Melville, Rhode Island, into the late fall of 1948. She was berthed in a shallow water anchorage not normally used by active vessels and served as a breakwater protecting other ships of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet berthed at Melville. On 2 November 1948, the erstwhile minesweeper and salvage vessel was delivered to her purchaser, Joseph Demaso, of Miami, Florida, and scrapped soon thereafter.\n\n\n== References ==\nThis article incorporates text from the public domain Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships.\n\n\n== External links ==\nNavSource Online: Mine Warfare Vessel Photo Archive - Willet (ARS 12) - ex-AM-54", "links": ["3\"/50 caliber gun", "Atlantic Reserve Fleet", "Babcock & Wilcox", "Breakwater (structure)", "Caribbean", "Convoy", "Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships", "Gulf of Mexico", "Gun mounts", "Key West, Florida", "Lapwing-class minesweeper", "Lapwing class minesweeper", "List of mine warfare vessels of the United States Navy", "Melville, Rhode Island", "Miami, Florida", "Minesweeper", "Minesweeper (ship)", "Navy list", "New York City", "Philadelphia Navy Yard", "Public domain", "Raven-class minesweeper", "Rescue and salvage ship", "Steam engine", "Survey ship", "USS Auk (AM-38)", "USS Avocet (AM-19)", "USS Bittern (AM-36)", "USS Bobolink (AM-20)", "USS Brant (AM-24)", "USS Cardinal (AM-6)", "USS Chewink (AM-39)", "USS Condor (AM-11)", "USS Cormorant (AM-40)", "USS Curlew (AM-8)", "USS Eider (AM-17)", "USS Falcon (AM-28)", "USS Finch (AM-9)", "USS Flamingo (AM-32)", "USS Gannet (AM-41)", "USS Grebe (AM-43)", "USS Heron (AM-10)", "USS Kingfisher (AM-25)", "USS Lapwing (AM-1)", "USS Lark (AM-21)", "USS Mallard (AM-44)", "USS Oriole (AM-7)", "USS Ortolan (AM-45)", "USS Osprey (AM-29)", "USS Owl (AM-2)", "USS Partridge (AM-16)", "USS Peacock (AM-46)", "USS Pelican (AM-27)", "USS Penguin (AM-33)", "USS Pigeon (ASR-6)", "USS Plover (AM-12)", "USS Quail (AM-15)", "USS Rail (AM-26)", "USS Redwing (AM-48)", "USS Robin (AM-3)", "USS Sanderling (AM-37)", "USS Sandpiper (AM-51)", "USS Seagull (AM-30)", "USS Swallow (AM-4)", "USS Swan (AM-34)", "USS Tanager (AM-5)", "USS Teal (AM-23)", "USS Tern (AM-31)", "USS Thrush (AM-18)", "USS Turkey (AM-13)", "USS Viking (ARS-1)", "USS Vireo (AM-52)", "USS Warbler (AM-53)", "USS Whippoorwill (AM-35)", "USS Widgeon (AM-22)", "USS Woodcock (AM-14)", "United States Coast and Geodetic Survey", "United States Navy", "United States Shipping Board", "World War I", "World War II"]}
