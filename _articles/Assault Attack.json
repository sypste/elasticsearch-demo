The album was recorded in France at the Château d'Hérouville and was produced by Martin Birch.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nAfter returning to the UK from Japan in August 1981, having recorded the live album One Night at Budokan, Schenker and his band played a short tour of the UK. After the tour, Cozy Powell and Peter Mensch (Michael Schenker Group's manager) wanted a better singer for the band and suggested David Coverdale, but Schenker himself wanted Graham Bonnet. After some disagreements, which ultimately led to the termination of the cooperation between Mensch and MSG, Bonnet joined the MSG in February 1982. Meanwhile, Powell and Paul Raymond left the band for their own reasons and were replaced by drummer Ted McKenna and session keyboardist Tommy Eyre. After four months the band went to France to start recording the album that would become Assault Attack with producer Martin Birch, who arrived fresh from Iron Maiden's album The Number of the Beast. The sessions took place at a French castle, Le Château d'Hérouville.\nThis was the last time until the Tales of Rock'n'Roll album that Schenker and Bonnet cooperated. The BBC broadcast of the Reading Festival concert was released in 1993 as BBC Radio 1 Live in Concert - this featured a returning Gary Barden on vocals.\nMore recent CD reissues contains the bonus track \"Girl from Uptown\", the b-side of \"Dancer\", the album's sole single. The title track was featured in the 2009 video game Brütal Legend.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAttracting mixed reviews on release, Assault Attack is now looked on more favourably, and Schenker himself is considered by many critics to be in top form.In 2005, Assault Attack was ranked number 481 in Rock Hard magazine's book of The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nSongwriters listed in brackets.\n\nSide one\"Assault Attack\" (Michael Schenker, Graham Bonnet, Chris Glen, Ted McKenna) -  4:16\n\"Rock You to the Ground\" (Schenker, Bonnet) - 5:48\n\"Dancer\" (Schenker, Bonnet) - 4:41\n\"Samurai\" (Schenker, Bonnet, Glen) - 5:16Side two\"Desert Song\" (Schenker, Bonnet) - 5:51\n\"Broken Promises\" (Schenker, Bonnet, Glen) - 6:21\n\"Searching for a Reason\" (Schenker, Bonnet) - 3:46\n\"Ulcer\" (Schenker) - 3:53\n\n\n=== Bonus track on the 2009 CD reissue ===\n\"Girl from Uptown\" (Schenker, Bonnet) - 5:21\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nBand membersGraham Bonnet – vocals\nMichael Schenker – guitar\nChris Glen – bass guitar\nTed McKenna – drumsAdditional musicianTommy Eyre – keyboardsProductionMartin Birch – producer, engineer\nBenedict Tobias Fenner, Patrick Droguet – engineers\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==", "links": ["Album", "AllMusic", "Andy Nye", "Arachnophobiac", "BBC", "Barry Sparks", "Be Aware of Scorpions", "Billboard (magazine)", "Billboard 200", "Billy Sheehan", "Brian Tichy", "Brütal Legend", "Built to Destroy (Michael Schenker Group album)", "Carmine Appice", "Chris Glen", "Chris Slade", "Chrysalis Records", "Château d'Hérouville", "Collector's Guide Publishing", "Cozy Powell", "David Coverdale", "David VanLanding", "Denny Carmassi", "Derek St. Holmes", "Don Airey", "Doogie White", "Francis Buchholz", "Gary Barden", "Graham Bonnet", "Hard rock", "Heavy Hitters", "Heavy metal music", "Herman Rarebell", "ISBN (identifier)", "In the Midst of Beauty", "Iron Maiden", "James Kottak", "Jeff Martin (American musician)", "Jeff Pilson", "Jeffrey Kollman", "Jesse Harms", "Kelly Keeling", "Leif Sundin", "List of Michael Schenker band members", "MBRG (identifier)", "MSG (album)", "Martin Birch", "Martin Popoff", "Metal Hammer", "Michael Schenker", "Michael Schenker Group", "Michael Schenker Group discography", "Mo Foster", "Music genre", "Neil Murray (British musician)", "Official Charts Company", "One Night at Budokan", "Oricon", "Paul Raymond (musician)", "Pete Way", "Peter Mensch", "Raymond Louis Kennedy", "Record label", "Record producer", "Robin McAuley", "Rock Hard (magazine)", "Rock Will Never Die", "Rovi Corporation", "Shane Gaalaas", "Simon Phillips (drummer)", "Single (music)", "Stuart Hamm", "Sverigetopplistan", "Tales of Rock'n'Roll", "Ted McKenna", "The 30th Anniversary Concert: Live in Tokyo", "The Michael Schenker Group (album)", "The Michael Schenker Story Live", "The Number of the Beast (album)", "The Unforgiven (album)", "The Unforgiven World Tour", "Tommy Eyre", "UK Albums Chart", "Written in the Sand (album)"]}
