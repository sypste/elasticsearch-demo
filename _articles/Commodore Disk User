It was aimed at Commodore users who had a 1541 disk drive and did not want to have to type in program listings. It also meant that larger programs could be included with the magazine. Initially, an issue of the magazine was published every two months but after two years, it became monthly.The magazine survived until the end of 1991. The last issue (number 36) was cover dated October 1991. Copies were scanned into Archive.org in 2011.\n\n\n== References ==",
