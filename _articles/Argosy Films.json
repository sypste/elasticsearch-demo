Bennett, Ronald H. Wolff, Cecil V. Stevenson, Noel Monkman, Harold L. Gray, and Joseph A. Byron. The general manager was Frederick Daniell.\nIn 1940 it was announced they would make two feature films, with 60% of the cost to be guaranteed by the New South Wales government. The two films were to be Daughters of Australia, budgeted at £12,500, and Man Without a Country, at a cost of £12,500 (these were later re-titled That Certain Something (1941) and The Power and the Glory (1941) respectively).Plans for further production – including a version of the Stingaree stories – did not come to fruition and the company was liquidated in 1948.Argosy is not to be confused with the British film company of the same name.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nArogsy Films at National Film and Sound Archive", "links": ["Argosy Pictures", "Barrier Daily Truth", "National Film and Sound Archive", "Noel Monkman", "Stingaree (character)", "That Certain Something", "The Flying Doctor", "The Power and the Glory (1941 film)", "The Sydney Morning Herald", "VIAF (identifier)", "Western Mail (Western Australia)"]}
