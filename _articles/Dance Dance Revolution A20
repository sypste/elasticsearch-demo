A location test in Europe began on October 7, 2019, and ended on March 16, 2020.\nDance Dance Revolution A20 Plus is an expansion pack that adds 106 new songs, 19 new courses, and other content. It was released on July 1, 2020 for Japanese 20th Anniversary cabinets and on July 6, 2020 for cabinets using an upgrade kit.\n\n\n== Development ==\nOn July 4, 2018, Konami opened a Dance Dance Revolution Twitter account in preparation of the series' 20th anniversary, which was celebrated on September 26, 2018. Dance Dance Revolution 20th Anniversary was announced at JAEPO 2019 as a placeholder. The game was first announced on January 26, 2019 during the Dance Dance Revolution A grand final of The 8th KONAMI Arcade Championship finals.\n\n\n== Features ==\nThe game features the notable return of courses, which was removed in Dance Dance Revolution (2013). There are two kinds of courses, only selectable on the first stage: Nonstop and Class. Unlike the previous main Dance Dance Revolution arcade games, courses are accessed from the song selection screen instead of a separate menu, similar to both Dancing Stage EuroMix games. Both Nonstop and Class play four songs back-to-back. All NONSTOP courses can be switched to CHALLENGE MODE if the LIFE GAUGE option is set to RISKY or LIFE4. Class, intended to measure the player's skill, places a stricter rules on the gameplay; the player cannot change Turn and Assist options and is forced to play on the \"Grade\" life gauge, which starts out full and depletes faster if it goes down. Players are given a martial arts-inspired \"dan rank\" certification based on the player's chosen course difficulty.  Class is available for golden cabinets only and unavailable in Versus Play. With the installation of the blue interface, it's possible to switch languages in-game, including Japanese, English and Korean as options.\nThe game introduces a new cabinet design based on the Dance Rush cabinet, but colored gold.\n\n\n== Events ==\n\n\n=== Extra Stage ===\nThe Extra Stage system retains the star requirement introduced in Dance Dance Revolution X3 VS 2ndMix. The player is required to obtain 9 stars in a round to be allowed an extra song, the number of stars of which is determined by the player's grade. Extra Stages can only be obtained in Premium Mode. For players in Asia territories and North America, this requires \"Premium Play\" to be selected when the game starts. For players in Japan, Premium Play requires Konami's PASELI payment system.\n\n\n==== Extra Exclusive ====\nThis folder is essentially a replacement for the traditional Extra Stage system of the previous games: the songs in this folder are marked in red and can only be played in Extra Stage.\n\n\n==== Extra Savior Plus ====\nOriginally from Dance Dance Revolution A, Extra Savior, now renamed Extra Savior Plus, was added on July 16, 2020 and allows the player to unlock hidden songs by playing them in Extra Stage. These not only include new additions for this game, but also some hidden songs yet to be unlocked for the general public from previous games. This time around, EXTRA SAVIOR works more akin to EXTRA ATTACK from the 2014 game, where charts must be unlocked in order: BEGINNER (only in SINGLE and is unlocked by selecting song) → BASIC → DIFFICULT → EXPERT. Players will earn the same amount of unlock progress regardless of what difficulty is played during EXTRA STAGE. Unlocking a chart requires either clearing the song, or enough failed attempts to unlock it. EXPERT charts require two stage clears or equivalent progress from failed attempts.  Using ASSIST options will lower clear progress.\n\n\n=== Summer Dance Camp ===\nThe Summer Dance Camp event is a collaboration event between Dance Dance Revolution series and DANCERUSH STARDOM. Stamps can be earned by playing either Dance Dance Revolution A20 (Plus) or DANCERUSH STARDOM. Three stamps are offered once per day, one for the game being played and two for the opposite game. By collecting a certain number of stamps for a specific game, songs will be unlocked for the respective game. Part 1 was available from August 8, 2019 to September 30, 2019 and all songs are available by default in A20 PLUS. Part 2 started on July 7, 2020 and ended on September 7, 2020 and all songs are unlockables via EXTRA SAVIOR PLUS since March 8, 2021.\n\n\n=== Dance Dance Revolution 20th Anniversary Grand Finale ===\nThe Dance Dance Revolution 20th Anniversary Grand Finale event began on September 5, 2019 and ended on December 31, 2019. By accumulating certain total numbers of score points, CHALLENGE charts for the Dance Dance Revolution 20th Anniversary songs could be unlocked.\n\n\n=== Ichika no BEMANI Touhyou Senbatsusen 2019 ===\nIchika no BEMANI Touhyou Senbatsusen 2019 (いちかのBEMANI投票選抜戦2019) is a collaboration event between beatmania IIDX 26 Rootage, Dance Dance Revolution A20, DANCERUSH STARDOM, GITADORA EXCHAIN, jubeat festo, pop'n music peace, SOUND VOLTEX VIVID WAVE, and ノスタルジア Op.2.

All past Floor Infection songs are available by default on February 27, 2020.\n\n\n=== Course Trial ===\nThe Course Trial unlocking system allows players to unlock songs by clearing courses from the Course Trial folder.

The release date was first confirmed by a flyer at a Japanese Round One Entertainment arcade on March 3, 2019. The flyer announced that the golden cabinets serve as a timed exclusive on these new cabinets, while upgrade kits released later. The game features revivals of classic licensed songs, NONSTOP and CLASS courses, and new Golden League events. Legend Licenses, Golden League, and CLASS courses are available for golden cabinets only; however, the phase 11 of the Golden League cannot demoted all players due to COVID-19 outbreak. New cabinets feature a 55\" monitor at 1080p; however, the game operates at 720p.\nOn May 15, 2019, Dance Dance Revolution A20 was imported in the United States at Round One. It ran on the Japanese software until September 24, 2019, when Round One implemented the localized software build in Dance Dance Revolution A20 cabs in the same month that Round One's competitor Dave & Buster's received the localization software build for its Dance Dance Revolution A cabs. On May 29, 2019, Round One confirmed that all of its American locations will receive A20 in the form of imported golden cabinets. This initially introduced the game to 32 locations at the time of release, most of which also feature a localized version of Dance Dance Revolution A. While players are free to select their own location on e-Amusement, the imported A20 cabinets are registered to the Osaka Prefecture in Japan, rather than the player's state.\n\n\n=== Upgrade Kits (Blue) ===\nOn June 2, 2019, Dave & Buster's vice president Kevin Bachus confirmed that Dance Dance Revolution A20 is receiving a localized software build in North America, which can be installed on existing white cabinets in Canada and the USA.

Software upgrades for the region were released on September 24, 2019, except for the state of Hawaii, which received a localized release on June 19, 2020. This North American release is unique for being a physical hardware upgrade kit, requiring a new license key and USB flash drive installation to upgrade the game software. This upgrade kit is only compatible with Dance Dance Revolution A cabinets, and the marquee from A remains unchanged. The Hawaiian and Asian song lists are identical, while continental North America features a smaller song list.\nUpgrade kits for older cabinets were released on July 24, 2019 in Japan and Asia, except for South Korea, which received a localized release on August 1, 2019.

Since July 25, 2019, Dan courses allow for short breaks in-between songs, referred to as \"Break Time\". Dan courses are exclusive for golden cabinets. Courses marked in bronze requires bronze class in the golden league, in silver requires silver class and in gold requires gold class.\nDance Dance Revolution A20\n\nDance Dance Revolution A20 Plus\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website(In Japanese)",
