He taught at the City College of New York.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBellush was born in the Bronx, New York City on November 15, 1917. He graduated from CCNY in 1941. He entered Columbia University in 1941 for graduate training in history. He completed a master's degree with a thesis on Eugene V. Debs, and two days after submission in November 1942 he was inducted into the United States Army. During the war he served with the 616th Ordnance Ammunition Company, and as part of the 5th Engineer Special Brigade he landed on Omaha Beach on D-Day, June 6, 1944.  Returning to the United States and demobilized after the war, he attended Columbia University's doctoral program in history and received his Ph.D. in 1951 under the direction of Allan Nevins.\nHe subsequently taught at his alma mater, the City College of New York, for the remainder of his academic career.\n\n\n== Scholarly impact ==\nBellush's work is remembered through several memorial awards.
