A set is low if it has low degree. Since every set is computable from its jump, any low set is computable in 0′, but the jump of sets computable in 0′ can bound any degree r.e. in 0′ (Schoenfield Jump Inversion).  X being low says that its jump X′ has the least possible degree in terms of Turing reducibility for the jump of a set.\nA degree is low n if its n'th jump is the n'th jump of 0. A set X is generalized low if it satisfies X′ ≡T X + 0′, that is: if its jump has the lowest degree possible. And a degree d is generalized low n if its n'th jump is the (n-1)'st jump of the join of d with 0′.
