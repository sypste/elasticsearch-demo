Yellow Cab was involved in a bitter rivalry with Checker Taxi at the time which led to a number of shootings, deaths, and firebombings.By 1925 the company was a subsidiary of the Chicago Yellow Cab Company, a public holding company with shares equally divided between Hertz, Parmelee, and a small group of other investors. Hertz sold the Yellow Cab Manufacturing Company to General Motors in 1925.He sold his remaining interest in the Yellow Cab Company in 1929 to Morris Markin, who had established Checker Cab Manufacturing Company as a driver cooperative with the Checker Taxi. Hertz had decided to focus on car rentals (later Hertz Rent-a-Car which incidentally still uses a yellow logo).
