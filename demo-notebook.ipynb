    "Elasticsearch indexes data using an [inverted index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index), allowing fast searches across massive textual datasets. By default, texts / strings are indexed as type [`text`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/text.html) as well as [`keyword`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/keyword.html). So far, we have been searching on fields of type `text`, using the default [standard analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-standard-analyzer.html), that tokenizes text and works well in most generic use cases. However, it has limitations once typos, a google-like search-as-you-type feel or domain-specific normalization come into play."
