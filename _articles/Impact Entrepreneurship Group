    "content": "Impact Entrepreneurship Group is a Canadian non-profit youth-run organization. Founded in 2004, it aims to foster and develop entrepreneurship among university and high school students. It has offices in Vancouver, Calgary and Waterloo, Ontario. To fulfill its aim, Impact has a number of different programs and initiatives to promote youth entrepreneurship and leadership, both at the local and national level. The organization currently consists of over 100 student volunteers across Canada.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nImpact was founded in 2004 by Kunal Gupta, who was a first-year software engineering student at the University of Waterloo. Gupta, along with his classmate Gaurav Jain and three others, envisioned a non-profit, student-run organization promoting entrepreneurship among Canadian youth in order to advocate entrepreneurship among high school, university, and college students.\n\n\n== Current Initiatives ==\nImpact organizes many local events and programs, mainly in Southern Ontario. Its national initiatives include the following:\n\n\n=== EntrepreneurHub ===\nA new initiative launched in 2011, EntrepreneurHub.ca is a website built to connect startups to students and recent graduates who are looking for employment opportunities in startups. The website is also used by entrepreneurs to connect with each other to form partnerships.\n\n\n=== I Am My Ambition ===\nI Am My Ambition is a series of short videos released by Impact, in which entrepreneurs, philanthropists, and politicians share their experiences, successes and failures. The aim of this project is to showcase these people in a way that youth can easily relate to, and in a way that would inspire youth.\n\n\n=== Impact Apprentice ===\nBased on the successful reality show The Apprentice, Impact Apprentice is an annual nationwide business competition between student teams from universities across Canada.\nAlthough over 1000 individuals apply to Impact Apprentice each year, only about 32 students are chosen to participate in the competition. Factors taken into account during the application process include business knowledge, leadership talents, and their entrepreneurial experience.In the Impact Apprentice competition, the teams are placed under high-pressure situations, where they are required to make key decisions in their business. Thus, the competition aims to test not only the students’ academic knowledge, but also their ability to face realistic business challenges. For example, the students will be asked to manage real profits and budgets and face challenges in sales, consulting, management, and advertising. However, unlike the reality show that it was based on, no candidates will be \"fired\" if they fail a task, but instead, points are awarded based on the teams’ success. In the end, the winning team shares $10 000 in grand prizes.Past competitions were professionally filmed and were uploaded onto the Internet, where the episodes reached over 4000 views in less than three months.\n\n\n=== Impact Gala ===\nStarting in 2011, Impact Gala will be an annual event that brings together entrepreneurs, industry leaders, top students, and Impact members and partners to celebrate the entrepreneurial community. Impact Gala will feature networking opportunities, keynote addresses, and an awards ceremony.\n\n\n=== Impact Microcredit ===\nImpact Microcredit is a national competition in which teams of students from high schools across Canada are given $100 to launch a business idea and make as much money as possible within a week. Proceeds from the competition are donated to charities chosen by the winners.  The teams are judged based on their creativity of their business plans, the effectiveness of their execution, as well as their profits. The winning teams are awarded scholarships, admission to the Encounters With Canada program, cash prizes, as well as various scholarships and grants.\n\n\n== Past Presidents ==\nKunal Gupta\nAlbert Lam\nRay Cao\nSarah Katyal\nAlex Shipillo\nVino Jeyapalan\nDaniel Rodic\nJaxson Khan\n\n\n== Past Initiatives ==\n\n\n=== Impact Connect ===\nImpact Connect organized entrepreneurship competitions, networking events, and seminars throughout the year, with the aim of exposing interested students into the realm of entrepreneurship.
