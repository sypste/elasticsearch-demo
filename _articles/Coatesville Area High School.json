In 1940, the high school was relocated to what is now the Scott Middle School. In 1968, the high school was relocated to the current campus just east of the City of Coatesville, into the current CASH building. The high school campus contains a large amount of land, much of it forested hillside, abutting the nearby Veteran's Hospital. The old stone house that had belonged to the previous owners became part of the district administration and remained on the campus. Several CCIU facilities are located on the high school campus, including the Center for Arts and Technology (CAT), a vocational school for county high schoolers.\nDuring the early 1990s, the high school expanded and the CAIHS building was constructed on the site of the former swamp land, and became home to the 9th and 10th grades. CASH remained the home for the 11th and 12th grades, and a new football stadium was constructed on what had been open grass land The original football stadium (Scott Field) is located in the center of Coatesville and is used currently used by other organizations. The CAIHS building (or 9/10 Center) was not designed for the site, but instead used a predesigned building. An artificial hill had to be constructed to accommodate this building layout, and this caused major settlement issues following the building's construction. Most of these problems were resolved by ground and foundation repairs in the early years of the building, however the building continues to be monitored, and several crack gauges can be found all over the building's walls. Until the building was renamed the 9/10 Center in 2002, it was typically referred to by the nickname Chaos, a mispronunciation of the building's actual name, CAIHS, and a reference to the highly rowdy nature of the building, which was often overcrowded. The connotations associated with a high school containing two buildings bearing the common names of Chaos and Cash were a large motivator for the renaming of the buildings into the 9/10 Center and 11/12 Center.\nAlthough certain grades are assigned to each of the two buildings, class scheduling, facility location, and necessity creates some student flow between the buildings between classes.\n\n\n== Notable alumni ==\nJoseph Gennaro and Rodney Linderman, members of The Dead Milkmen\nRichard Hamilton, former professional basketball player and NBA Champion in 2004\nDerrick Morgan, former professional football player\n\n\n== References ==", "links": ["2004 NBA Finals", "Achievement House Charter School", "Athletic nickname", "Avon Grove Charter School", "Avon Grove High School", "Avon Grove School District", "Bishop Shanahan High School", "Caln Township, Pennsylvania", "Center for Arts and Technology", "Charter schools", "Chester County, Pennsylvania", "Church Farm School", "Coatesville, Pennsylvania", "Coatesville Area School District", "Coatesville Veterans Administration Hospital Historic District", "Collegium Charter School", "Conestoga High School", "Derrick Morgan (American football)", "Devon Preparatory School", "Downingtown Area School District", "Downingtown High School", "Downingtown STEM Academy", "Geographic coordinate system", "Great Valley High School", "Great Valley School District", "Joseph Genaro", "Kennett Consolidated School District", "Kennett High School (Pennsylvania)", "Kimberton Waldorf School", "Malvern Preparatory School", "Octorara Area School District", "Octorara Junior-Senior High School", "Owen J.
