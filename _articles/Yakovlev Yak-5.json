This aircraft, the Yak-5, was a low-wing monoplane of wooden construction, but unlike the UT-2, had the front cockpit removed and an enclosed sliding canopy placed over the rear cockpit. A retractable tailwheel undercarriage replaced the fixed landing gear of the UT-2. It was powered by a Shvetsov M-11D five-cylinder radial producing 115 hp (86 kW), which drove a two-bladed variable-pitch propeller. It could be fitted with a single synchronized ShKAS machine gun aimed by a reflector sight, while the aircraft was also fitted with a radio.\n\n\n== Operational history ==\nThe prototype Yak-5 first flew on 7 September 1944. The new fighter-trainer's handling proved popular with its test pilots, and the aircraft successfully passed official evaluation. In the end, neither the UT-2L or the Yak-5 entered production because the Soviet Air Force command believed wooden aircraft were becoming obsolete, which would result in production of the all-metal Yakovlev Yak-18 trainer in late 1945. The sole Yak-5 was destroyed when it suffered failure of the wooden wing during a snap roll and crashed.\n\n\n== Specifications (Yak-5) ==\nData from Yakovlev Aircraft since 1924General characteristics\nCrew: 1\nLength: 7.3 m (23 ft 11 in)\nWingspan: 10.5 m (34 ft 5 in)\nWing area: 17 m2 (180 sq ft)\nEmpty weight: 770 kg (1,698 lb)\nMax takeoff weight: 940 kg (2,072 lb)\nPowerplant: 1 × Shvetsov M-11D 5-cylinder air-cooled radial piston engine, 86 kW (115 hp)\nPropellers: 2-bladed VISh-237 variable-pitch propellerPerformance\n\nMaximum speed: 250 km/h (160 mph, 130 kn) \nLanding speed: 85 km/h (53 mph; 46 kn)\nRange: 450 km (280 mi, 240 nmi)\nTake-off run: 180 m (590 ft)\nLanding run: 200 m (660 ft)Armament\n1x 7.62 mm (0.300 in) ShKAS machine-gun with 300 roundsAvionics\nPBP-1 reflector sight\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\nSourcesGordon, Yefim, Dmitry Komissarov and Sergey Komissarov.
