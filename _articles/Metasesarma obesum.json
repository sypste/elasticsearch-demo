It is a semiterrestrial and brackish-water crab that lives on sandy beaches.\n\n\n== In aquaria ==\nThey are occasionally found in the aquarium trade. They require land area, hiding places such as leaf litter or driftwood, and shallow brackish/salt water. It is omnivorous and generally peaceful to tankmates and conspecifics, however it might fight with conspecifics if it does not have enough space.\n\n\n== References ==",
