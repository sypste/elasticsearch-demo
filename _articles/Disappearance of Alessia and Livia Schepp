Matthias Schepp, their father, picked up his twin daughters from his ex-wife's home in St-Sulpice and they never returned. The body of Matthias was later found in Italy, where the authorities presumed that he had committed suicide. The fate of the six-year-old girls has remained unknown since January 30, 2011. Their disappearance led to a police hunt across Switzerland, France and Italy.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAlessia and Livia were twin sisters, born on October 7, 2004. The girls were the only children of Irina Mayme Lucidi Schepp, an Italian-born Swiss lawyer, and Matthias Kaspar Schepp, 43, a Canadian-born Swiss engineer. They married in July 2004 in Ascoli Piceno, Italy. They both worked for the tobacco company Philip Morris.One year previously the couple had split up, living in the same village, but in separate homes.\n\n\n== Timeline ==\nThe following timeline is based on a Swiss Police publication:\nFriday 28 January: Matthias Schepp picks up his daughters to spend the weekend with them.\nSaturday 29 January: Schepp sends an SMS to his wife: \"we are all right, we'll return on Monday\".\nSunday 30 January\nat 12:00: The girls are seen for the last time with Schepp in Saint-Sulpice, Vaud.\nat 17:04: Schepp crosses the border into France.\nMonday 31 January\nat 12:30: Schepp withdraws money from several cashpoints in Marseille.\nSchepp sends a postcard to his wife from Marseille.\nSchepp and the girls take an evening ferry to Propriano, in Corsica.\nTuesday 1 February\nat 06:30: Schepp disembarks in Propriano, with or without his daughters.\nat 21:00: Schepp takes a ferry from Bastia in northeast Corsica and arrives at Toulon the next morning at 07:00.\nWednesday 2 February at 09:13: Schepp is photographed alone at a toll.\nThursday 3 February\nat 12:00: Schepp is observed by a witness in Naples, Italy.\nat 22:47: Schepp throws himself under a train at Cerignola, in the south-east Italian region of Apulia.\n\n\n== Possible murder by Matthias Schepp ==\nIn February 2011 police investigators said that Schepp sent a letter to his wife suggesting that he had killed the children.  The letter was not released to the public.  According to CNN, the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera was allowed to publish a single sentence from the letters which said \"The children rest in peace, they have not suffered\".  A search of Schepp's computer showed that in the days leading up to the trip, he searched for information about firearms and poisons, along with the timetables for the ferry.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n2011 in Switzerland\nList of people who disappeared\nMissing Children Switzerland (in French)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nInterpol Notice\nInterpol Notice for Livia Clara Schepp\nInterpol Notice for Alessia Vera Schepp",
