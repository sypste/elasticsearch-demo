Many of the tracks are experimental; some recordings adhere to fairly traditional song formats while others offer audiobook-like readings with ambient accompaniment.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Waywords and Meansigns project began in 2014 with a goal of setting James Joyce's Finnegans Wake to music unabridged. They released two unabridged editions of the text, in 2015 and 2016. Over 300 people have been involved in Wayords and Meansigns since 2014.The Waywords and Meansigns Opendoor Edition features contributors from 15 different countries in what was called \"an all-star cast of weirdos.\" The music is often experimental; the musicians' only requirements were that \"the words be audible, unabridged and more or less in their original order.\" All audio from the project is distributed freely online under Creative Commons licensing.\nContributors to Waywords and Meansigns are a self-described collection of \"musicians, artists, poets, scholars, weirdos, passionate Wake-heads, those totally ignorant of the Wake, and anyone generally adventurous.\" Artists participating in the Opendoor Edition include: Krzysztof Bartnicki; Martyn Bates; John Wolf Brennan; Neil Campbell; Tim Carbone of Railroad Earth and Lou Rogai of Lewis & Clarke; Joe Cassidy of Butterfly Child; Hayden Chisholm; S.A. Griffin; Kinski; Ulrich Krieger; Jason Sebastian Russo; David Moss; Monica Queen; Schneider TM; Sally Timms; Mike Watt; and many more.The Guardian has highlighted the project for making Joyce's famously difficult novel more accessible. Finn Fordham, a James Joyce scholar at Royal Holloway, University of London has called the project \"wonderfully innovative.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nTracks are organized by page and line number, followed by the artist name, and then occasionally followed by the track's nickname.\nChapter 1 (pp. 003-029)\n     003-010.24 - The Here Comes Everybody Players\n     003.01-003.09 - Hervé Michel and the box sets\n     003.01-003.14 - Roman Tsivkin and the box sets\n     010.25-016.09 - Chris Rael\n     013.20-015.11 - Peter Chrisp and the box sets\n     018.17-021.04 - John Cerreta - \"Stoop to Prittle\"\n     023.16-024.14 - Nigel Bryant - \"O Foenix Culprit\"\n     027.22-029.36 - Cedar Sparks (Tim Carbone and Lou Rogai)\nChapter 2 (pp. 030-047)\n     030-047 - Krzysztof Bartnicki and Bouchons d'oreilles with Wojtek Kurek\n     045-046 - Yehuda Vizan and the box sets\nChapter 3 (pp. 048-074)\n     048-050.35 - Wiel Conen & Charlotte Gilissen\n     052.18-053.35 - S.A.
