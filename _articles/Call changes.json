All cause two bells to swap.  The first form is used for calling up and calling down, and the second form swaps the two bells mentioned.\n\n\n== Use ==\nCall changes are a valuable step in the learning process for aspirant method ringers. They are normally the next step after learning to control a bell and accurately ring it in \"rounds\". Call changes are valuable in teaching bell-handling skills, such as the ability to judge the distance to be left over other bells (this is different according to the size of the bell being followed) and to move bells from one place to another in a row. Apart from their training role, call changes are widely rung by choice, or where there are not enough method ringers present in a tower.\n\n\n== Devon call-change ringing ==\n\nCall changes are also rung as a form of change ringing in their own right, principally in parts of Devon and Cornwall.  \nThe Devon Association of Ringers represents call change church bell ringers in Devon and was founded in 1925. The association has 160 affiliated towers and arranges training events, social events and ringing festivals. The call change tradition emphasises rhythmic ringing in simple musical sequences, and there are many noted compositions.The following is the most well-known call change peal on six bells. It is the test piece for Devon  Association call-change competitions, together with raising and lowering in peal before and after. The calling strategy, or plan is shown below. This means the conductor does not have to memorise the 60-plus calls, but only the overall plan.\n\"Sixty on thirds\".\n\nCall the bells to Queens.
